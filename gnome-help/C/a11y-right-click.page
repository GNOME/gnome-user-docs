<title>Simulate a right mouse click</title>

<p>You can right-click by holding down the left mouse button. This is useful if
you find it difficult to move your fingers individually on one hand, or if your
pointing device only has a single button.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> tab.</p></item>
  <item><p>Switch <gui>Simulated Secondary Click</gui> on.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>You can change how long you must hold down the left mouse button for before
it is registered as a right click. On the <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> tab,
change the <gui>Acceptance delay</gui> under <gui>Simulated Secondary Click</gui>.</p>

<p>I wanted to document that the pointer fills up with blue, and you get a
right-click when it's full. But it only seemed to work on the arrow pointer,
and now it's not even working there for me. Investigate.</p>

<p>To right-click with simulated secondary click, hold down the left mouse
button where you would normally right-click, then release. You will only
right-click once you release the mouse button. If you use
<link xref="mouse-mousekeys">Mouse Keys</link>, this will also allow you to
right-click by holding down the <key>5</key> key on your keypad.</p>

<note>
<p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, you are always able to long-press
to right-click, even with this feature disabled. Long-press works slightly
differently in the overview: You do not have to release the button to
right-click.</p>
