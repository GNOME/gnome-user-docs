  <title>Turn on slow keys</title>

  <p>Turn on <em>slow keys</em> if you would like there to be a delay between
  pressing a key and that letter being displayed on the screen. This means that
  you have to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it
  appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time when
  you type, or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the keyboard
  first time.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Typing</gui>
      tab.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Switch <gui>Slow Keys</gui> on.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <note style="tip">
    <title>Quickly turn slow keys on and off</title>
    <p>Under <gui>Enable by Keyboard</gui>, select
    <gui>Turn on accessibility features from the keyboard</gui> to
    turn slow keys on and off from the keyboard. When this option is selected,
    you can press and hold <key>Shift</key> for eight seconds to enable or
    disable slow keys.</p>
    <p>You can also turn slow keys on and off by clicking the
    <link xref="a11y-icon">accessibility icon</link> on the top bar and
    selecting <gui>Slow Keys</gui>. The accessibility icon is visible when
    one or more settings have been enabled from the <gui>Universal Access</gui>
    panel.</p>
  </note>

  <p>Use the <gui>Acceptance delay</gui> slider to control how long you have to
  hold a key down for it to register.</p>

  <p>You can have your computer make a sound when you press a key, when a key
  press is accepted, or when a key press is rejected because you didn't hold
  the key down long enough.</p>
