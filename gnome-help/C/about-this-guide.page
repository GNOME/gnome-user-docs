<title>About this guide</title>
<p>This guide is designed to describe the features of your desktop, answer your computing-related questions, and provide tips on using your computer more effectively.</p>
<p>There are several features of the guide that we think make it easy to use.</p>

<list>
  <item><p>The guide is sorted into small, task-oriented topics--not chapters. This means that you don't need to skim through an entire manual to find the answer to your questions.</p></item>
  <item><p>Related-items are linked together. "See-also" links at the bottom of some pages will direct you to related topics. This makes it easy to find similar topics that might help you perform a certain task.</p></item>
  <item><p>It includes built-in search. The bar at the top of the help browser is a <em>search bar</em>, and relevant results will start appearing as soon as you start typing.</p></item>
  <item><p>The guide is constantly being improved. Although we attempt to provide you with a comprehensive set of helpful information, we know we won't answer all of your questions here. We will keep adding more information to make things more helpful, though.</p></item>
</list>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read the <em>Desktop Help Guide</em>. We sincerely hope that you will never have to use it.</p>
