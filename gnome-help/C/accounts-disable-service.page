<title>Control which online services an account can be used to access</title>

<p>Some types of online account allow you to access several services with the
same user account. For example, Google accounts provide access to calendar,
email, contacts and chat. You may want to use your account for some services,
but not others. For example, you may want to use your Google account for email
but not chat, since you have a different online account that you use for chat.
</p>

<p>You can disable some of the services that are provided by each online
account:</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Open the <app>Online Accounts</app> settings from the Activities
  overview.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select the account you want to change from the list on the left.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>A list of services that are available with this account will be
  shown under <gui>Use this account for</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Switch off any of the services that you don't want to be used.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<p>Once a service has been disabled for an account, applications on your
computer won't be able to use the account to connect to that service any more.
</p>

<p>To turn on a service that you disabled, just go back to the <gui>Online
Accounts</gui> window and switch it on.</p>
