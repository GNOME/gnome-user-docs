<title>Why should I add an account?</title>

  <p>Adding your accounts brings your choice of services like calendar, chat
  and e-mail straight to your desktop and makes the information of the services
  a seamless part of your user experience. By adding accounts you can easily
  keep in touch with services of different accounts, like chats, at the same
  time. Just set your account once and every time you start your computer all
  the accounts and services you've added are ready for you.</p>
