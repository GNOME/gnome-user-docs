  <title>Why should I add an account?</title>
  <p>Adding your accounts brings your choice of services like calendar, chat and e-mail
  straight to your desktop and makes the information of the services a seamless part of
  your user experience. By adding accounts you can easily keep in touch with services of
  different accounts, like chats, at the same time. Just set your account once and every
  time you start your computer all the accounts and services you chose to add are ready
  for you.</p>
