<title>Frequency of backups</title>

<p>How often you make backups will depend on the type of data to be backed up. For example, if you are running a network environment with critical data stored on your servers, then even nightly backups may not be enough.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you are backing up the data on your home computer then you may need to factor in a few things, such as:
</p>

<list>
<item><p>The amount of time you spend on the computer.</p></item>
<item><p>How often and by how much the data on the computer changes.</p></item>
</list>

<p>
If it is just some music, e-mails and family photos, then weekly or even monthly backups may suffice. However, if you happen to be in the middle of a tax audit, more frequent backups may be necessary.
</p>

<p>As a general rule, the amount of time in between backups should be no more than the amount of time you could stand to spend re-doing any lost work. For example, if spending a week re-writing lost documents is too long for you, you should back-up at least once per week.</p>
