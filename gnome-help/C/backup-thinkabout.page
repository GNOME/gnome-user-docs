  <title>Where can I find the files I want to back up?</title>

<p>
Deciding what files to backup and finding where they all are is the most difficult step when attempting to perform a backup.  Below is a list of where most of your important files should be, so you can find them more easily.
</p>

<item>
   <title>Your personal files and settings</title>
<p>These are usually stored in your Home folder (<cmd>/home/your_name</cmd>). They could be in subfolders such as Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos and/or .evolution (for email). If your backup medium has sufficient space, consider backing up the entire <cmd>/home</cmd> folder. This is the simplest way.</p>

<p>
      If you are not able to backup all of <cmd>/home</cmd>, see below for a list of some subfolders of the <cmd>/home</cmd> folder to check for important files.

<note>
<list>
<item><p><cmd>~/</cmd> represents your home folder <cmd>/home/your_name</cmd> </p></item>

 <item><p>Any file or folder name that starts with a period is hidden by default. To view hidden files, click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq>.
