  <title>What to back up</title>

<p>	
Your priority should be to backup your <link xref="backup-thinkabout">most important files</link> as well as those that are difficult to recreate.  An example of most important to least important:
</p>

<terms>
 <item>
   <title>Your personal files </title>
   <p>Documents, spreadsheets, email, calendar appointments, financial data, family photos, anything that you made that has importance to you. These are clearly the most important as they may be irreplaceable.</p>
    </item>

  <item>
  <title>Your personal settings</title>
  <p> This includes changes you may have made to colors, backgrounds, screen resolution and mouse settings on your desktop. This also includes application preferences, such as settings for <app>LibreOffice</app>, your music player, and your email program. These are replaceable, but may take a while to recreate.</p>
</item>

<item>
<title>System settings</title>
<p>Most people never change the settings that are created during installation. If you do customize your system, you may wish to backup these settings.
</p>
</item>

<item>
<title> Installed software (and everything else). </title>
<p> Such software can usually be restored by reinstalling it.</p>
</item>
</terms>

    <p>
    In general, you will want to backup files that are irreplaceable and files that require a great time investment to replace without a backup. If things are easy to replace, on the other hand, you may not want to use up disk space by having backups of them.</p>
