  <title>Pairing instructions for specific devices</title>

  <p>Even if you manage to source the manual for a device, it might not contain
  enough information to make pairing possible. Here are details for a few common
  devices.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 joypads</title>
      <p>Those devices use “cable-pairing”. Plug the joypads in via USB with the
      <gui>Bluetooth Settings</gui> opened, and Bluetooth turned on. After pressing the
      “PS” button, you will get asked whether to set those joypads up. Unplug them and
      press the “PS” button to use them over Bluetooth.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 4 joypads</title>
      <p>Those devices use “cable-pairing” as well. Plug the joypads in via USB with the
      <gui>Bluetooth Settings</gui> opened, and Bluetooth turned on. You will get asked whether
      to set those joypads up without needing to press the PS button. Unplug them and press the
      PS button to use them over Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>Using the “PS” and “Share” button combination to pair the joypad can also be used to
      make the joypad visible and pair it like any other Bluetooth device, if you don’t have
      a USB cable at hand.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 BD Remote Control</title>
      <p>Hold the “Start” and “Enter” buttons at the same time for around 5 seconds.
      You can then select the remote in the devices list as usual.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Nintendo Wii and Wii U Remotes</title>
      <p>Use the red “Sync” button inside the battery compartment to start the pairing
      process. Other button combinations will not keep pairing information, so you would
      need to do it all over again in short order. Also note that some software wants
      direct access to the remotes, and, in those cases, you should not set them up in
      the Bluetooth panel. Refer to the application’s manual for instructions.</p>
