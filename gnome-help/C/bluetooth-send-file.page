    phones or other computers. Some types of devices don't allow the transfer
    of files, or specific types of files. You can send files in one of three
    ways: using the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, from the Bluetooth settings
    window, or directly from the file manager.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Send files using the Bluetooth icon</title>
    <item>
      <if:choose>
        <if:when test="platform:unity">
      <p>Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and select <gui>Send Files to Device</gui>.</p>
        </if:when>
      <p>Click the Bluetooth icon on the top bar and select <gui>Send Files to Device</gui>.</p>
      </if:choose>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Choose the file you want to send and click <gui>Select</gui>.</p>
      <p>To send more than one file in a folder, hold down <key>Ctrl</key> as you select each file.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the device which you want to send the files to and click <gui>Send</gui>.</p>
      <p>The list of devices will show both <link xref="bluetooth-connect-device">devices you
      are already connected to</link> as well as <link xref="bluetooth-visibility">visible
      devices</link> within range. If you have not already connected to the selected device,
      you will be prompted to pair with the device after clicking <gui>Send</gui>. This will
      probably require confirmation on the other device.</p>
      <p>If there are many devices, you can limit the list to only specific device types
      using the <gui>Device type</gui> drop-down.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>The owner of the receiving device usually has to press a button to accept the file. Once the owner accepts or declines, the result of the file transfer will be shown on your screen.</p>

    only shows devices you've already connected to. See
    <link xref="bluetooth-connect-device"/>.</p></item>
