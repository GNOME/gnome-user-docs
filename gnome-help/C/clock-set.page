<p>Once there, click on <gui>Unlock</gui> and type your password to be able to:</p> 
<list>
<item><p>Set the time manually by clicking on the arrows for the hour and minute hands.</p></item>
<item><p>Set the date manually by clicking on the drop-down menu.</p></item>
<item>
 <p>Have the clock update itself automatically by turning the <gui>Network Time</gui> ON.</p>
 <p>When <em>network time</em> is turned on, the computer will periodically synchronize its clock with a very accurate clock on the internet, so you don't have to do it manually. This will only work if you are connected to the internet.</p>
</item>
</list>

<p>You can also change the hour format display by turning the 24-hour format ON or OFF.</p>
