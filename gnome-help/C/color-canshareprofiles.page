  <title>Can I share my color profile?</title>

  <p>
    Color profiles that you have created yourself are specific to the
    hardware that you calibrated for.
    My DreamColor LP2480zx has been powered for a few hundred hours, and
    is going to have a very different color profile to a similar display
    with the next serial number if it's been lit for a thousand hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means if you share your color profile with somebody, you might
    be getting them <em>closer</em> to calibration, but it's misleading
    at best to say that thier display is calibrated.

    <p>
      You should carefully check the redistribution conditions for profiles
      downloaded from vendor websites or that were created on your behalf.
