  <title>How do I test if color management is working correctly?</title>

  <p>The effects of a color profile are sometimes subtle and it may be hard to
  see if anything much has changed.</p>

  <p>GNOME comes with several profiles for testing that make it very clear when
  the profiles are being applied:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Blue</title>
      <p>This will turn the screen blue and tests if the calibration curves are
      being sent to the display.</p>
    </item>
<!--    <item>
      <title>ADOBEGAMMA-test</title>
      <p>This will turn the screen pink and tests different features of a
      screen profile.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>FakeBRG</title>
      <p>This will not change the screen, but will swap around the RGB channels
      to become BGR. This will make all the colors gradients look mostly
      correct, and there wonâ€™t be much difference on the whole screen, but
      images will look very different in applications that support color
      management.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> overview and
      start typing <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Devices</gui> in the sidebar.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Color</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the device for which you want to add a profile. You may wish to
      make a note of which profile is currently being used.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Add profile</gui> to select a test profile, which should be
      at the bottom of the list.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press <gui>Add</gui> to confirm your selection.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To revert to your previous profile, select the device in the
      <gui>Color</gui> panel, then select the profile that you were using
      before you tried one of the test profiles and press <gui>Enable</gui> to
      use it again.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>


  <p>Using these profiles, you can clearly see when an application supports
  color management.</p>
