 <title>Checking the hard disk</title>
<p>Hard disks have a built-in health-check called <em>SMART</em>. This continually checks for potential problems, and can warn you if the disk is about to fail. This is useful for avoiding future loss of important data.</p>
<p>To check your disk's health status:</p>
<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Go to <gui>Activities</gui> in the top left corner of the screen and start the <app>Disk Utility</app>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Select your hard drive in the <gui>Storage Devices</gui> list. Information will appear about the disk and its status under <gui>Drive</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p><gui>SMART Status</gui> should say "Disk is healthy".</p>
 </item> 
 <item>
  <p>To see details of the data and tests applied, click on the <gui>SMART Data</gui> button located below <gui>SMART Status</gui>.</p>
 </item>
</steps>

 <title>What if the disk isn't healthy?</title>
 <p>Even if the <gui>SMART Status</gui> indicates that the disk <em>isn't</em> healthy, there may be no cause for alarm. However, it's better to be prepared with a <link xref="backup-why">backup</link> to prevent data loss. You may wish to take the computer/hard disk to a professional for further diagnosis and repair.</p>
 <p>If the status says "Pre-fail", the disk is still reasonably healthy but signs of wear have been detected which mean it might fail in the near future. If your hard disk (or computer) is a few years old, you are likely to see this message on at least some of the health checks. You should <link xref="backup-how">backup your important files regularly</link> and check the disk status periodically to see if it gets worse.</p>

 <p>Use palimpsest to check the hard disk for errors. Why might you want to do this? What should you do if it finds errors? Also discuss the SMART data in palimpsest.</p>
