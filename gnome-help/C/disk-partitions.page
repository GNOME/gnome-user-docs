<title>Manage volumes and partitions</title>

<p>The word <em>volume</em> is used to describe areas of storage that your computer has made available for your use. The computer makes this storage accessible via your file system in a process referred to as <em>mounting</em>. Mounted volumes may be hard drives, USB drives, DVD-RWs, SD cards, and other media.</p>

<p>Often, a mounted volume is called a <em>partition</em>, though they are not identical. "Partition" refers to one or more <em>physical</em> areas of storage on a single drive. Once a partition has been mounted, it can be called a volume. You can think of volumes as the labeled, accessible “storefronts” to the functional “back rooms” of partitions and drives.</p>

<steps>
  <title>View and manage volumes and partitions using <app>Disk Utility</app></title>
 <item>
  <p>Go to <gui>Activities</gui> in the top left corner of the screen and start the <app>Disk Utility</app>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p> In the pane marked <gui>Storage Devices</gui>, you will find hard disks, CD/DVD drives, and other physical devices. Click on a device of interest.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
 <p> In the right pane, the area labeled <gui>Volumes</gui> provides a visual breakdown of the volumes and partitions present on the selected device. It also contains a variety of tools used to manage these volumes. Be careful, it is possible to completely erase the data on your disk with these utilities.</p>
</item>
</steps>

<p>Your computer most likely has at least one <em>primary</em> partition and a single <em>swap</em> partition. The swap partition is used by your operating system for memory management, and is rarely mounted.  The primary partition contains your operating system, applications, settings, and personal files. These files can be distributed among multiple partitions for security or convenience.</p>

<p>One primary partition must contain information that your computer uses to start up, or <em>boot</em>. For this reason it is sometimes called a boot partition, or boot volume. To determine if a volume is bootable, look for <gui>Partition Flags</gui> in <gui>Disk Utility</gui>. External media such as USB drives and CDs may also contain a bootable volume.</p>
