    <desc>Automatically run applications for CDs and DVDs, cameras,
    audio players, and other devices and media.</desc>

  <!-- TODO: fix bad UI strings, then update help -->
  <title>Open applications for devices or discs</title>

  <p>You can have an application automatically start when you plug in a device
  or insert a disc or media card. For example, you might want your photo
  organizer to start when you plug in a digital camera. You can also turn this
  off, so that nothing happens when you plug something in.</p>

  <p>To decide which applications should start when you plug in various
  devices: </p>

<steps>
  <item>
    <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> overview and
    start typing <gui>Removable Media</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Select <guiseq><gui>Settings</gui><gui>Apps</gui></guiseq> from the
    results. This will open the <gui>Apps</gui> panel.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Select <gui>Default Apps</gui> to open the panel.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>In the <gui>Removeable Media</gui> section, switch the
    <gui>Automatically Launch Apps</gui> switch to on.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Find your desired device or media type, and then choose an application
    or action for that media type. See below for a description of the different
    types of devices and media.</p>
    <p>Instead of starting an application, you can also set it so that the
    device will be shown in the file manager, with the <gui>Open folder</gui>
    option. When that happens, you will be asked what to do, or nothing will
    happen automatically.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>If you do not see the device or media type that you want to change in
    the list (such as Blu-ray discs or E-book readers), click <gui>Other
    Media</gui> to see a more detailed list of devices. Select the type of
    device or media from the <gui>Type</gui> drop-down and the application or
    action from the <gui>Action</gui> drop-down.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>If you do not want any applications to be opened automatically, whatever
    you plug in, switch the <gui>Automatically Launch Apps</gui> switch to off.</p>

  <item>
    <title>Audio discs</title>
    <p>Choose your favorite music application or CD audio extractor to handle
    audio CDs. If you use audio DVDs (DVD-A), select how to open them under
    <gui>Other Media</gui>. If you open an audio disc with the file manager,
    the tracks will appear as WAV files that you can play in any audio player
    application.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Video discs</title>
    <p>Choose your favorite video application to handle video DVDs. Use the
    <gui>Other Media</gui> button to set an application for Blu-ray, HD DVD,
    video CD (VCD), and super video CD (SVCD). If DVDs or other video discs
    do not work correctly when you insert them, see <link xref="video-dvd"/>.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Blank discs</title>
    <p>Use the <gui>Other Media</gui> button to select a disc-writing
    application for blank CDs, blank DVDs, blank Blu-ray discs, and blank HD
    DVDs.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Cameras and photos</title>
    <p>Use the <gui>Photos</gui> drop-down to choose a photo-management
    application to run when you plug in your digital camera, or when you insert
    a media card from a camera, such as a CF, SD, MMC, or MS card. You can also
    simply browse your photos using the file manager.</p>
    <p>Under <gui>Other Media</gui>, you can select an application to open
    Kodak picture CDs, such as those you might have made in a store. These are
    regular data CDs with JPEG images in a folder called
    <file>Pictures</file>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Music players</title>
    <p>Choose an application to manage the music library on your portable music
    player, or manage the files yourself using the file manager.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>E-book readers</title>
      <p>Use the <gui>Other Media</gui> button to choose an application to
      manage the books on your e-book reader, or manage the files yourself
      using the file manager.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Software</title>
      <p>Some discs and removable media contain software that is supposed to be
      run automatically when the media is inserted. Use the <gui>Software</gui>
      option to control what to do when media with autorun software is
      inserted. You will always be prompted for a confirmation before software
      is run.</p>
      <note style="warning">
        <p>Never run software from media you donâ€™t trust.</p>
