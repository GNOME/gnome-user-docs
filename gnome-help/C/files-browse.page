<title>Browse files and folders</title>

<p>Use the <app>Files</app> file manager to browse and organize the files on 
your computer. You can also use it to manage files on storage devices (like 
external hard disks), on <link xref="nautilus-connect">file servers</link>, and 
network shares.</p>

<p>To open the file manager, open <app>Files</app> in the <gui>Activities</gui> 
overview. You can also search for files and folders through the overview in the 
same way you would <link xref="shell-apps-open">search for applications</link>. 

<p>In the file manager, double-click any folder to view its contents,
and double-click any file to open it with the default application for
that file. You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab
or new window. In <link xref="files-sort#list-view">list view</link>, 
you can also click the expander next to a folder to show its contents 
in a tree.</p>

<p>The <em>path bar</em> above the list of files and folders shows you which
folder you're viewing, including the parent folders of the current folder. 
Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder. Right-click any 
folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or window, copy or move it, or 
access its properties.</p>

<p>If you want to quickly skip to a file in the folder you're viewing, 
start typing its name. A search box will appear at the bottom of the window and 
the first file which matches your search will be highlighted. Press the 
<key>down arrow</key> or <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>G</key></keyseq>, or 
scroll with the mouse, to skip to the next file that matches your search.</p>

<p>You can quickly access common places from the <em>sidebar</em>. If you do
not see the sidebar, click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Sidebar</gui>
<gui>Show Sidebar</gui></guiseq>. You can add bookmarks to folders that
you use often and they will appear in the sidebar. Use the 
<gui>Bookmarks</gui> menu to do this, or simply drag a folder into the 
sidebar.</p>

<p>If you frequently move files between nested folders, you might
find it more useful to show a <em>tree</em> in the sidebar instead. Click
<guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Sidebar</gui><gui>Tree</gui></guiseq>
to enable the tree sidebar. Click the expander arrow next to a folder to
show its child folders in the tree, or click a folder to open it
in the window.</p>

	<p>This page is a feature overview. There should be a greater visual separation between features. Small illustrative figures should be used to display these features where appropriate, and video demonstrations of some of the features might be useful too. Explain how you can add things to the sidebar (link to a topic or explain it here).</p>
