	<p>This page is a feature overview. There should be a greater visual
	separation between features. Small illustrative figures should be used
	to display these features where appropriate, and video demonstrations of
	some of the features might be useful too. Explain how you can add things to
	the sidebar (link to a topic or explain it here).</p>

<p>Use the <app>Files</app> file manager to browse and organize the files on
your computer. You can also use it to manage files on storage devices (like
external hard disks), on <link xref="nautilus-connect">file servers</link>, and
on network shares.</p>

<p>To start the file manager, open <app>Files</app> in the
<gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> overview. You can also search
for files and folders through the overview in the same way you would
<link xref="shell-apps-open">search for applications</link>.
</p>

<section id="files-view-folder-contents">
  <title>Exploring the contents of folders</title>

<p>In the file manager, double-click any folder to view its contents, and
double-click or <link xref="mouse-middleclick">middle-click</link> any file to
open it with the default application for that file. Middle-click a folder to
open it in a new tab. You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab
or new window.</p>

<p>When looking through the files in a folder, you can quickly <link
xref="files-preview">preview each file</link> by pressing the space bar
to be sure you have the right file before opening it, copying it, or
deleting it.</p>

<p>The <em>path bar</em> above the list of files and folders shows you which
folder youâ€™re viewing, including the parent folders of the current folder.
Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder. Right-click any
folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or window, or access its
properties.</p>

<p>If you want to quickly <link xref="files-search">search for a file</link>,
in or below the folder you are viewing, start typing its name. A <em>search
bar</em> will appear at the top of the window and only files which match your
search will be shown. Press <key>Esc</key> to cancel the search.</p>

<p>You can quickly access common places from the <em>sidebar</em>. If you do
not see the sidebar, press the <gui>Show Sidebar</gui> button in the top-left
corner of the window. You can <link xref="nautilus-bookmarks-edit">add bookmarks
to folders that you use often</link> and they will appear in the sidebar.</p>
