<title>Find a lost file</title>

<p>If you created or downloaded a file, but now you can't find it,
follow these tips.</p>

<list>
  <item><p>If you don't remember where you saved the file, but you
  have some idea of how you named it, you can search for the file
  by name. See <link xref="files-search"/> to learn how.</p></item>

  <item><p>If you just downloaded the file, your web browser might
  have automatically saved it to a common folder. Check the
  Desktop and Downloads folders in your home folder.</p></item>

  <item><p>You might have accidentally deleted the file. When you delete
  a file, it gets moved to the trash, where it stays until you manually
  empty the trash. See <link xref="files-recover"/> to learn how to
  recover a deleted file.</p></item>

  <item><p>You might have renamed the file in a way that made the file hidden.
  Files that start with a <file>.</file> or end with a <file>~</file> are hidden
  in the file manager. Click the
  <media type="image" src="figures/go-down.png">down</media> button in the file
  manager toolbar and pick <gui>Show Hidden Files</gui> to display them. See
  <link xref="files-hidden"/> to learn more.</p></item>
