  <title>Search for files</title>

  <p>You can search for files based on their name or file type directly
  within the file manager. You can even save common searches, and they
  will appear as special folders in your home folder.</p>

  <links type="topic" style="linklist">
    <title>Other search applications</title>
    <!-- This is an extension point where search apps can add
    their own topics. It's empty by default. -->
  </links>

  <steps>
    <title>Search</title>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <app>Files</app> application from the
      <gui xref="shell-terminology">Activities</gui> overview.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If you know the files you want are under a particular folder, go to
      that folder.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Type a word or words that you know appear in the file name, and they
      will be shown in the search bar. For example, if you name all your
      invoices with the word "Invoice", type <input>invoice</input>. Words are
      matched regardless of case.</p>
      <note>
        <p>Instead of typing words directly to bring up the search bar, you can
	click the magnifying glass in the toolbar, or press
        <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>F</key></keyseq>.</p>
      </note>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You can narrow your results by location and file type.</p>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>Click <gui>Home</gui> to restrict the search results to your
          <file>Home</file> folder, or <gui>All Files</gui> to search
          everywhere.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Click the <gui>+</gui> button and pick a <gui>File Type</gui> from
	  the drop-down list to narrow the search results based on file type.
	  Click the <gui>x</gui> button to remove this option and widen the
	  search results.</p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You can open, copy, delete, or otherwise work with your files from the
      search results, just as you would from any folder in the file
      manager.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the magnifying glass in the toolbar again to exit the search and
      return to the folder.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you perform certain searches often, you can save them to access them
  quickly.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Save a search</title>
    <item><p>Start a search as above.</p></item>
    <item><p>When you are happy with the search parameters, click the menu
    button and select <gui>Save Search As</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Give the search a name and click <gui>Save</gui>. If you like,
    select a different folder to save the search in. When you view that folder,
    you will see your saved search as an orange folder icon with a magnifying
    glass on it.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>To remove the search file when you are done with it, simply
  <link xref="files-delete">delete</link> the search as you would any other
  file. When you delete a saved search, it does not delete the files that the
  search matched.</p>
