<title>What is a file with a "~" at the end of its name?</title>

<note>
  <p>Files with a "~" at the end of their names (for example,
 <file>example.txt~</file>) are automatically created backup copies of documents
 edited in the <app>Gedit</app> text editor or other applications. It is
 normally safe to delete them, but there really is no need.</p>

  <p>These files are hidden by default. If you are seeing them, that is because
 you either selected <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Hidden Files</gui></guiseq> or
 pressed <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq>. You can hide them again
 by repeating one of these steps.</p> 
</note>

  <p>These files are treated in the same way as normal hidden files. See
 <link xref="files-hidden"/> for advice on dealing with hidden files.</p>
