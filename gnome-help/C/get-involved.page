   <title>Submit an issue</title>

   <p>This help documentation is created by a volunteer community. You are
   welcome to participate. If you notice a problem with these help pages
   (like typos, incorrect instructions or topics that should be covered but
   are not), you can submit a <em>new issue</em>. To submit a new issue, go to
   the <link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-user-docs/issues">issue
   tracker</link>.</p>

   <p>You need to register, so you can submit an issue and receive updates by
   email about its status. If you do not already have an account, click the
   <gui><link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/users/sign_in">Sign in / Register</link></gui>
   button to create one.</p>

   <p>Once you have an account, make sure you are logged in, then go back to the
   <link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-user-docs/issues">documentation
   issue tracker</link> and click
   <gui><link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-user-docs/issues/new">New
   issue</link></gui>. Before reporting a new issue, please
   <link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-user-docs/issues">browse</link>
   for the issue to see if something similar already exists.</p>

   <p>Before submitting your issue, choose the appropriate label in the
   <gui>Labels</gui> menu. If you are filing an issue against this
   documentation, you should choose the <gui>gnome-help</gui> label. If you are
   not sure which component your issue pertains to, do not choose any.</p>

   <p>If you are requesting help about a topic that you feel is not covered,
   choose <gui>Feature</gui> as the label. Fill in the Title and Description
   sections and click <gui>Submit issue</gui>.</p>

   <p>Your issue will be given an ID number, and its status will be updated as
   it is being dealt with. Thanks for helping make the GNOME Help better!</p>
