<title>Media card reader problems</title>

<p>Many computers contain readers for SD, MMC, SM, MS, CF, and other storage media
cards. These should be automatically detected and <link xref="disk-partitions">mounted</link>. Here are some
troubleshooting steps if they are not:</p>

<steps>
<item>
<p> Make sure that the card is put in correctly. Many cards look as though they are
upside down when correctly inserted. Also make sure that the card is firmly seated
in the slot; some cards, especially CF, require a small amount of force to insert
correctly. (Be careful not to push too hard! If you come up against something solid,
do not force it.)</p>
</item>

<item>
  <p>Open <app>Files</app> from the
  <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> overview. Does the inserted
  card appear in the <gui>Devices</gui> list in the left sidebar? Sometimes the
  card appears in this list but is not mounted; click it once to mount. (If the
  sidebar is not visible, press <key>F9</key> or click <gui style="menu">Files</gui> in
  the top bar and select the <gui style="menuitem">Sidebar</gui>.)</p>
</item>

<item>
  <p>If your card does not show up in the sidebar, press
  <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>L</key></keyseq>, then type
  <input>computer:///</input> and press <key>Enter</key>. If your card reader
  is correctly configured, the reader should come up as a drive when no card is
  present, and the card itself when the card has been mounted.</p>
</item>

<item>
<p>If you see the card reader but not the card, the problem may be with the card itself.
Try a different card or check the card on a different reader if possible.</p>
</item>
</steps>

<p>If no cards or drives are shown when browsing the <gui>Computer</gui>
location, it is possible that your card reader does not work with Linux due to
driver issues. If your card reader is internal (inside the computer instead of
sitting outside) this is more likely. The best solution is to directly connect
your device (camera, cell phone, etc.) to a USB port on the computer. USB
external card readers are also available, and are far better supported by
Linux.</p>
