<title>Click and move mouse pointer using the keypad</title>

<p>If you have difficulties using a mouse or other pointing device, you can
control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. This
feature is called <em>mouse keys</em>.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq>
  to give keyboard focus to the top bar.</p></item>
  <item><p>Use the right and left arrow keys to select the
  <link xref="a11y-icon">universal access menu</link>, then press
  <key>Enter</key>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Use the up and down arrow keys to select <gui>Mouse Keys</gui>
  and press <key>Enter</key>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Make sure that <key>Num Lock</key> is turned off. You will now be
  able to move the mouse pointer using the keypad.</p></item>
</steps>

 <note style = "tip">
 <p>These instructions provide the shortest way to enable mouse keys using
 only the keyboard. Select <gui>Universal Access Settings</gui> to see more
 accessibility options.</p>
 </note>

<p>The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard, usually arranged
into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as a laptop
keyboard), you may need to hold down the function (<key>Fn</key>)
key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this
feature often on a laptop, you can purchase external USB keypads.</p>

<p>Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example, pressing
<key>8</key> will move the pointer upwards and pressing <key>2</key> will move
it downwards. Press the <key>5</key> key to click once with the mouse, or
quickly press it twice to double-click.</p>

<p>Most keyboards have a special key which allows you to right-click, sometimes
called the <key xref="keyboard-key-menu">Menu</key> key. Note, however, that
this key responds to where your keyboard focus is, not where your mouse pointer
is. See <link xref="a11y-right-click"/> for information on how to right-click by
holding down <key>5</key> or the left mouse button.</p>

<p>If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled,
turn <key>Num Lock</key> on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad when
<key>Num Lock</key> is turned on, though.</p>

<note>
    <p>The normal number keys, in a line at the top of the keyboard, will not
    control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.</p>
