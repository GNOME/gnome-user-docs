<title>Mouse Pointer Not Moving</title>


<section id="plugged-in">
 <title>Check That the Mouse is Plugged In</title>
 <p>
 If you have a mouse with a cable, check that it is firmly plugged in to 
 your computer.
 </p>
 <p>
 If it is a USB mouse (with a rectangular connector), try plugging it in to a 
 different USB port. If it is a PS/2 mouse (with a small, round connector with 
 six pins), make sure that it is plugged in to the green mouse port rather 
 than the purple keyboard port. You may need to restart the computer if it was 
 not plugged in.

 <steps>
  <item>
   <p>
   Click <guiseq><gui>Alt</gui><gui>F2</gui></guiseq>.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item><p>
  Type <input>gnome-terminal</input>.  A terminal window will open.
  </p></item>
  <item>
   <p>
   In the terminal window, at the prompt (the $), type <cmd>xsetpointer -l | grep Pointer</cmd>, exactly as it appears here, 
   and press <key>Enter</key>.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>
   A short list of mouse devices will appear. Check that at least one 
   of the items says <quote>[XExtensionPointer]</quote> next to it, and that one of the  <quote>[XExtensionPointer]</quote> items has the name of the mouse to the left of it.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item><p>
  If there is no entry that has the name of the mouse followed by  <quote>[XExtensionPointer]</quote>, then the mouse was not recognized by your computer. If the entry exists, your mouse was recognized by your computer.  In this case you should check that the mouse is <link xref="#plugged-in">plugged</link> in and in <link xref="#broken">working condition</link>.
  </p></item>
 </steps>

 <p>
 If your mouse has a serial (RS-232) connector, you may need to perform some 
 extra steps to get it working. The steps might depend on the make or model of 
 your mouse.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 It can be complicated to fix problems with mouse detection. Ask for support 
 from your distribution/vendor if you think that your mouse has not been 
 detected properly.

  Should provide some useful advice rather than just saying "you might need to 
  perform extra steps".

 <title>Check the Mouse Actually Works</title>
 <p>
 Plug the mouse in to a different computer and see if it works.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If the mouse is an optical or laser mouse, a light should be shining out 
 of the bottom of the mouse if it is turned on.  If there is no light, check that it is turned on.  If it is and there is still no light, the mouse may be broken.

 <title>Checking wireless mice</title>
 
 <list>
  <item>
   <p>
   Click a button and see if the mouse pointer moves now. Some wireless mice go 
   to sleep to save power, so might not respond until you click a button.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>
   Check that the battery of the mouse is charged.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>
   Make sure that the receiver (dongle) is firmly plugged in to the computer.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>
   If your mouse and receiver can operate on different radio channels, make 
   sure that they are both set to the same channel.
   </p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>
   You may need to press a button on the mouse, receiver or both to establish 
   a connection. The instruction manual of your mouse should have more details 
   if this is the case.
   </p>
  </item>
 </list>

 <p>
 Most RF (radio) wireless mice should work automatically when you plug them 
 into your computer. If you have a bluetooth or IR (infrared) wireless mouse, 
 you may need to perform some extra steps to get it working. The steps might 
 depend on the make or model of your mouse.
