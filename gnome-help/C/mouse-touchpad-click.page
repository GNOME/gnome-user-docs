<title>Click or scroll with the touchpad</title>

<p>You can click, double-click, drag, and scroll using only your
touchpad, without separate hardware buttons.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select
   <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Open <gui>Mouse and Touchpad</gui> and select the <gui>Touchpad</gui>
   tab. The <gui>Touchpad</gui> tab will only be available if your computer has a
   touchpad.</p></item>
  <item><p>To click, double-click, and drag with your touchpad, select
  <gui>Enable mouse clicks with the touchpad</gui>.</p></item>
</steps>

<list>
<item><p>To click, tap on the touchpad.</p></item>
<item><p>To double-click, tap twice.</p></item>
<item><p>To drag an item, double-tap but don't lift your finger after the second tap.
Drag the item where you want it, then lift your finger to drop.</p></item>
<item><p>If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps, right-click by tapping with
two fingers at once. Otherwise, you still need to use hardware buttons to
right-click. See <link xref="a11y-right-click"/> for a method of right-clicking
without a second mouse button.</p></item>
<item><p>If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps,
<link xref="mouse-middleclick">middle-click</link> by tapping with three fingers
at once.</p></item>
</list>

<note><p>When tapping or dragging with multiple fingers, make sure your fingers
are spread far enough apart. If your fingers are too close, your computer may
think they're a single finger.</p></note>

<p>You can scroll using your touchpad using either the edges of
the touchpad or using two fingers.</p>

<p>Select <gui>Edge scrolling</gui> under <gui>Scrolling</gui> to
scroll using the edge of your touchpad. When this is selected, dragging
your finger up and down along the right side of your touchpad will
scroll vertically. If you also select <gui>Enable horizontal
scrolling</gui>, dragging your finger left and right along the
bottom of your touchpad will scroll horizontally.</p>

<p>Select <gui>Two-finger scrolling</gui> under <gui>Scrolling</gui>
to scroll with two fingers. When this is selected, tapping and
dragging with one finger will work as normal, but if you drag
two fingers across any part of the touchpad, it will scroll
instead. If you also select <gui>Enable horizontal scrolling</gui>,
you can move your fingers left and right to scroll horizontally.
Be careful to space your fingers a bit apart. If your fingers are
too close together, they just look like one big finger to your
touchpad.</p>

<note><p>Two-finger scrolling may not work on all touchpads.</p></note>
