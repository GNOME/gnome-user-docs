<title>Click or scroll with the touchpad</title>

<p>You can click, double-click, drag, and scroll using only your
touchpad, without separate hardware buttons. Access these features
in the mouse and touchpad settings.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Mouse and Touchpad</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select the <gui>Touchpad</gui> tab.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>To click, double-click, and drag with your touchpad, select
<gui>Enable mouse clicks with the touchpad</gui>. To click, tap
on the touchpad. To double-click, tap twice. To drag an item,
double-tap but don't lift your finger after the second tap.
Drag the item where you want it, then lift your finger to
drop. You still need to use hardware buttons to right-click.</p>

<p>You can scroll using your touchpad using either the edges of
the touchpad or using two fingers.</p>

<p>Select <gui>Edge scrolling</gui> under <gui>Scrolling</gui> to
scroll using the edge of your touchpad. When this is selected, dragging
your finger up and down along the right side of your touchpad will
scroll vertically. If you also select <gui>Enable horizontal
scrolling</gui>, dragging your finger left and right along the
bottom of your touchpad will scroll horizontally.</p>

<p>Select <gui>Two-finger scrolling</gui> under <gui>Scrolling</gui>
to scroll with two fingers. When this is selected, tapping and
dragging with one finger will work as normal, but if you drag
two fingers across any part of the touchpad, it will scroll
instead. If you also select <gui>Enable horizontal scrolling</gui>,
you can move your fingers left and right to scroll horizontally.
Be careful to space your fingers a bit apart. If your fingers are
too close together, they just look like one big finger to your
touchpad.</p>

<note><p>Two-finger scrolling may not work on all touchpads.</p></note>
