<title>File manager display preferences</title>

<p>You can control how the file manager displays captions under icons. Click
the menu button in the sidebar of the window, select
<gui>Preferences</gui>, then go to the <gui>Grid View Captions</gui> section.</p>

    <p>File manager icons with captions</p>
  </media>
  <p>When you use grid view, you can choose to have extra information about
  files and folders displayed in a caption under each icon. This is useful,
  for example, if you often need to see who owns a file or when it was last
  modified.</p>
  <p>You can zoom in a folder by pressing the menu button in the sidebar of the
  window and selecting one of the buttons under
  <gui style="menuitem">Icon Size</gui>. As you zoom in, the
  file manager will display more and more information in captions. You can
  choose up to three things to show in captions. The first will be displayed at
  most zoom levels. The last will only be shown at very large sizes.</p>
  <p>The information you can show in icon captions is the same as the
  columns you can use in list view. See <link xref="nautilus-list"/>
  for more information.</p>

  <title>List View</title>

  <p>When viewing files as a list, you can display <gui>Expandable Folders in
  List View</gui>. This shows expanders on each directory in the file list, so
  that the contents of several folders can be shown at once. This is useful if
  the folder structure is relevant, such as if your music files are organized
  with a folder per artist, and a subfolder per album.</p>
