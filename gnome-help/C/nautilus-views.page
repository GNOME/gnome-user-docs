<title>File manager views preferences</title>
<p>You can control the default view for new folders, how files and folders
are sorted by default, the zoom level for the icon and compact views, and
whether files are displayed in the tree sidebar. In any file manager window,
click <gui>Files</gui> in the top bar, select <gui>Preferences</gui> and select
the <gui>Views</gui> tab.</p>

  <item>
    <title><gui>View new folders using</gui></title>
    <p>By default, new folders are shown in icon view. You can select a view
    for each folder as you browse by clicking the list button or the icons
    button in the toolbar. If you often use the list view, you can set it here
    as the default.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Arrange items</gui></title>
    <p>You can change how files are sorted in an individual folder by clicking
    the down arrow button in the toolbar and choosing <gui>By Name</gui>,
    <gui>By Size</gui>, <gui>By Type</gui> or <gui>By Modification Date</gui>,
    or by clicking the list column headers in list view. See
    <link xref="files-sort"/> for details. This menu only affects the current
    folder.</p>
    <p>To change the default order used in new folders, use the
    <gui>Arrange items</gui> drop-down list in the preferences to sort by name,
    file size, file type, when they were last modified, when they were last
    accessed, or when they were trashed.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Sort folders before files</gui></title>
    <p>By default, the file manager will show all folders before files. Folders
    and files will each be arranged according to the selected sort order. If
    you would rather not treat folders specially and have them mixed with files
    according to the sort order, deselect this option.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title><gui>Show hidden and backup files</gui></title>
    <p>The file manager does not display hidden files or folders by default.
    See <link xref="files-hidden"/> for information on hidden files. You can
    show hidden files in an individual window by selecting
    <gui>Show Hidden Files</gui>,from the down arrow menu in the toolbar. If you
    prefer to always show hidden files, or want to see hidden files in every
    open file manager window, select this option.</p>

    <title><gui>Default zoom level</gui></title>
    <p>You can make the icons and text larger or smaller in icon view. You can
    do this in an individual folder by clicking the down arrow button in the
    toolbar and selecting <gui>Zoom In</gui>, <gui>Zoom Out</gui>, or
    <gui>Normal Size</gui>. If you frequently use a larger or smaller zoom
    level, you can set the default with this option.</p>
    <p>In icon view, more or fewer captions are shown based on your zoom level.
    See <link xref="nautilus-display#icon-captions"/> for more information.</p>

   <item>
    <title><gui>Default zoom level</gui></title>
    <p>You can make the icons and text larger or smaller in compact view. You can
    do this in an individual folder from the <gui>View</gui> menu, and the file
    manager will remember your zoom choice for each folder. If you frequently use
    a larger or smaller zoom level, you can set the default with this option.</p>
   </item>
   <item>
    <title><gui>All columns have the same width</gui></title>
    <p>By default, each column in compact view is as wide as it needs to be to
    fit the names of the items in that column. Selecting this option will make
    all the columns have the same width.  This will make files and folders that
    have names longer than the column width be displayed with an ellipsis (…)
    at the end.</p>

as well, turn <gui>Show only folders</gui> off.</p>
