  <title>Manually set network settings</title>

  <p>If your network doesn't automatically assign network settings to your
  computer, you may have to manually enter the settings yourself. This topic
  assumes that you already know the correct settings to use. If not, you may
  need to ask your network administrator or look at the settings of your router
  or network switch.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To manually set your network settings:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-terminology">Activities</gui> overview and
      start typing <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui> to open the control center.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Network</gui> to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the left pane, select the network connection that you want to set
      up manually and click the
      <media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/emblem-system.png"><span its:translate="yes">settings</span></media>
      button. For example, if you plug in to the network with a cable, click
      <gui>Wired</gui>. For a <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> connection, the 
      <media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/emblem-system.png"><span its:translate="yes">settings</span></media>
      button will be located next to the active network.</p>
      <p>Make sure that your wireless card is turned on or a network cable is
      plugged in.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>IPv4</gui> and change <gui>Addresses</gui> to
      <gui>Manual</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Type in the <gui>Address</gui> and <gui>Gateway</gui>, as well as the
      appropriate <gui>Netmask</gui>.</p>
      <p>These must be <em>IP addresses</em>; that is, they must be four
      numbers separated by periods (e.g. 123.45.6.78).</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the <gui>DNS</gui> section, switch <gui>Automatic</gui> to
      <gui>OFF</gui>. Enter the IP address of a DNS server you want to use.
      Enter additional DNS server addresses using the <gui>+</gui> button.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the <gui>Routes</gui> section, switch <gui>Automatic</gui> to
      <gui>OFF</gui>. Enter the <gui>Address</gui>, <gui>Netmask</gui>,
      <gui>Gateway</gui> and <gui>Metric</gui> for a route you want to use.
      Enter additional routes using the <gui>+</gui> button.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Apply</gui>. If you are not connected to the network, click
      the system status area on the top bar and connect. Test the network
      settings by trying to visit a website or look at shared files on the
      network, for example.</p>
    </item>
