  <title>Connect to a wired (Ethernet) network</title>

  <p>To set up most wired network connections, all you need to do is plug in a
  network cable. The network icon on the top bar should spin or pulse for a few
  seconds and then will change to a "socket" icon when you are connected.</p>

  <p>If this does not happen, you should first of all make sure that your
  network cable is plugged in. One end of the cable should be plugged into the
  rectangular Ethernet (network) port on your computer, and the other end
  should be plugged into a switch, router, network wall socket or similar
  (depending on the network setup you have). Sometimes, a light beside the
  Ethernet port will indicate that it is plugged in and active.</p>

  <note>
    <p>You can't plug one computer directly into another one with a network
    cable (at least, not without some extra setting-up). To connect two
    computers, you should plug them both into a network hub, router or
    switch.</p>
  </note>

  <p>If you are still not connected, your network may not support automatic
  setup (DHCP). In this case you will have to <link xref="net-manual">configure
  it manually</link>.</p>
