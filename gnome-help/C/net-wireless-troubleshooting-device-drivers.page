<title>Checking for wireless device drivers</title>

  <p>This guide is designed to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems with accessing a wireless network.</p>

  <section id="net-wireless-hardware-check">
    <title>Checking your system hardware</title>
  <p>Our first step will be to see if your computer recognizes your wireless adapter.</p>
  <steps>
   <item><p>Open a <app>terminal</app> window, and enter <cmd>sudo lshw -C network</cmd></p>
    <p>If you get no response, you may need to install the <app>lshw</app> program on your computer.</p></item>
   <item><p>Read the output from the command, and check for the <em>Wireless interface</em> section. If your wireless adapter is detected, the output should look similar to this:</p>
   <example> 
   <code><![CDATA[*-network
       description: Wireless interface
       product: PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection
       vendor: Intel Corporation

  </steps>
  <p>If a wireless device is listed, then continue to the Device Drivers page</p>
  <p>If a wireless device is not listed, the next steps will help you to locate the hardware information.</p>

   <section id="net-wireless-hardware-check2">
    <title>Further wireless hardware checks</title>
  <p>Because your wireless adapter was not found with the previous command, you need to take further steps to make sure your computer recognizes your adapter.</p>
  <p>The next steps will depend on the type of device that you use. Refer to the section that is relevant to the type of wireless adapter that you use with your computer: PCI (internal), USB, or PCMCIA.</p>
  <note><p>PCMCIA is an external, card-style adapter, and is more common on older hardware.</p></note>
