  <title>Wireless network troubleshooter</title>
  <subtitle>Perform an initial connection check</subtitle>

  <p>In this step you will check some basic information about your wireless
  network connection. This is to make sure that your networking problem isnâ€™t
  caused by a relatively simple issue, like the wireless connection being
  turned off, and to prepare for the next few troubleshooting steps.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Make sure that your laptop is not connected to a <em>wired</em>
      internet connection.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If you have an external wireless adapter (such as a USB adapter, or a
      PCMCIA card that plugs into your laptop), make sure that it is firmly
      inserted into the proper slot on your computer.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If your wireless card is <em>inside</em> your computer, make sure that 
      the wireless switch is turned on (if it has one). Laptops often have
      wireless switches that you can toggle by pressing a combination of
      keyboard keys.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Open the
      <gui xref="shell-introduction#systemmenu">system menu</gui> from the right
      side of the top bar and select the Wi-Fi network, then select <gui>Wi-Fi
      Settings</gui>. Make sure that the <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> switch is set to on.
      You should also check that <link xref="net-wireless-airplane">Airplane
      Mode</link> is <em>not</em> switched on.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Open the Terminal, type <cmd>nmcli device</cmd> and press
      <key>Enter</key>.</p>
      <p>This will display information about your network interfaces and
      connection status. Look down the list of information and see if there is
      an item related to the wireless network adapter. If the state is
      <code>connected</code>, it means that the adapter is working and connected
      to your wireless router.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you are connected to your wireless router, but you still cannot access
  the internet, your router may not be set up correctly, or your Internet
  Service Provider (ISP) maybe experiencing some technical problems. Review
  your router and ISP setup guides to make sure the settings are correct, or
  contact your ISP for support.</p>

  <p>If the information from <cmd>nmcli device</cmd> did not indicate that you were
  connected to the network, click <gui>Next</gui> to proceed to the next
  portion of the troubleshooting guide.</p>
