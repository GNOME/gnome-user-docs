<title>My computer connects to the wrong network</title>

<p>The instructions for accessing the network settings are wrong. Also, I don't
actually see how to accomplish this task with GNOME 3. Needs revision.</p>

<p>When you turn your computer on, your computer will automatically try to connect to wireless networks that you have connected to in the past. If it tries to connect to the wrong network each time (that is, not the one that you want it to connect to), do the following:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click the network icon on the top bar and select <gui>Edit Connections</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Go to the <gui>Wireless</gui> tab and find the network that you <em>don't</em> want it to keep connecting to.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click that network once to select it and click <gui>Delete</gui>. Your computer won't try to connect to that network any more.</p>
 </item>
 
</steps>

<p>If you later want to connect to the network that you just deleted, click on the network icon in the top panel and select the network from the list. You may need to re-enter the security settings for that network connection.</p>
