     brightness: powering the screen accounts for a significant fraction of a
     laptop power consumption.</p>

     whereas others have a keyboard shortcut that you can use instead. You can
     turn it on again when you need it.</p>

     actively using them. However, applications that frequently grab data from
     the internet, play music or movies can impact your power consumption.</p>
