<title>Why do I have less battery life than I did on Windows/Mac OS?</title>

<p>Some computers appear to have a shorter battery life when running on Linux than they do when running Windows or Mac OS. One reason for this is that computer vendors install special software for Windows/Mac OS that optimizes various hardware/software settings for a given model of computer. These tweaks are often highly specific, and may not be documented, so including them in Linux is difficult.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's not an easy way of applying these tweaks yourself without knowing exactly what they are. You may find that using some <link xref="power-batterylife">simple power-saving methods</link> helps, though. If your computer has a <link xref="power-batteryslow">variable-speed processor</link>, you might find that changing its settings is also useful.</p>

<p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy is that the method of estimating battery life is different on Windows/Mac OS than on Linux. The actual battery life could be exactly the same, but the different methods give different estimates. See <link xref="power-batteryestimate"/> for more information.</p>
