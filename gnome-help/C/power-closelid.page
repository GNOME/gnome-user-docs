<title>Why does my computer turn off when I close the lid?</title>

<p>When you close the lid of your laptop, your computer will <link
xref="power-suspend"><em>suspend</em></link> in order to save power. This means
that the computer is not actually turned off - it has just gone to sleep. You
can resume it by opening the lid. If it does not resume, try clicking the mouse
or pressing a key. If that still does not work, press the power button.</p>

<p>Some computers are unable to suspend properly, normally because their
hardware is not completely supported by the operating system (for example, the
Linux drivers are incomplete). In this case, you may find that you are unable
to resume your computer after you have closed the lid. You can try to <link
xref="power-suspendfail">fix the problem with suspend</link>, or you can
prevent the computer from trying to suspend when you close the lid.</p>

 <title>Stop the computer from suspending when the lid is closed</title>
 <p>If you do not want the computer to suspend when you close the lid, you can
 change the settings for that behavior. To set the computer to blank the
 screen, rather than suspend, when the lid is closed:</p>
 <note style="warning">
   <p>Be very careful if you change this setting. Some laptops can overheat
   if they are left running with the lid closed, especially if they are in
   a confined place like a backpack.</p>
