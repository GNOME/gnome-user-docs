<title>Clearing a paper jam</title>

<p>Sometimes printers incorrectly feed sheets of paper and get jammed.</p>

<p>The manual for your printer will usually provide detailed instructions on how
 to clear paper jams. Usually, you will need to open one of the printer's panels
 to find the jam inside and then firmly (but carefully!) pull the jammed paper
 out of the printer's feeding mechanism.</p>

<p>Once the jam has been cleared you may need to press the printer's
 <gui>Resume</gui> button to start printing again. With some printers, you may
 even need to turn the printer off and then on again, and then start the print
 job again.</p>
