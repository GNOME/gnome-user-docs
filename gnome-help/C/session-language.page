  <p>You can use your desktop and applications in any of dozens of languages, provided
  you have the proper language packs installed on your computer.</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Open <gui>Region and Language</gui> and select the <gui>Language</gui> tab.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select your desired language.
    Some translations may be incomplete, and certain applications may not
    support your language at all. Any untranslated text will appear in the
    language in which the software was originally developed, usually American
    English.</p></item>
    <item><p>You have to log out and back in for these changes to take
    effect. Click your name in the top bar and select <gui>Log Out</gui>
    to log out.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>There are some special folders in your home folder where applications
  can store things like music, pictures, and documents. These folders use
  standard names according to your language. When you log back in, you will
  be asked if you want to rename these folders to the standard names for
  your selected language. If you plan to use the new language all the time,
  you should update the folder names.</p>

    <p>When you change your language, you only change it for your account
    after you log in. You can also change the <em>system language</em>, the
    language used in places like the login screen.</p>

    <steps>
      <item><p>Change your language, as described above.</p></item>
      <item><p>Select the <gui>System</gui> tab.</p></item>
      <item><p>Click <gui>Copy Settings</gui>.</p></item>
      <item><p><link xref="user-admin-explain">Administrative privileges</link> are
