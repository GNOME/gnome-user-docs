  <p>More links would be good, especially in #logout. Could go final
  as-is. Incomplete for now</p>

<p>When you've finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it (to save power),
or leave it powered on and just log out.</p>

<section id="logout">
<title>Log out or switch users</title>
<p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave
yourself logged in and just switch users. If you just switch users, all of
your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you
left it when you log back in.</p>
<p>To log out or switch users, click your name on the top bar and select
the appropriate option.</p>

<title>Lock the screen</title>
<p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
screen to prevent other people from accessing your files and running
applications. When you return, simply enter your password to log back in.
If you don't lock your screen, it will lock automatically after a certain
amount of time.</p>

<p>To lock your screen, click your name on the top bar and select
<gui>Lock Screen</gui>.</p>

<p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts
by clicking <gui>Switch User</gui> on the password screen. You can switch
back to your desktop when they are finished.</p>

<title>Suspend</title>

<p>To save power, suspend your computer when you aren't using it. If you use
a laptop, GNOME suspends your computer automatically when you close your lid.
This saves your state to your computer's memory and powers off most of your
computer's functions. A very small amount of power is still used during suspend.</p>

<p>To suspend your computer manually, click your name on the top bar and select
<gui>Suspend</gui>.</p>

<section id="shutdown">

<title>Shut down or restart</title>

<p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart,
first log out by clicking your name on the top bar and selecting
<gui>Log Out</gui>. You will be returned to the login screen. On the
login screen, click the power icon on the top bar and select either
<gui>Restart</gui> or <gui>Shut Down</gui>.</p>

<p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to
power off or restart the computer, because this will end their sessions.
If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for your password
to power off.</p>

<note style="tip"><p>If you need to shut down or restart quickly, you
can do it without logging out. Click your name on the top bar, then
hold down the <key>Alt</key> key. The <gui>Suspend</gui> option will
change to <gui>Power Off</gui>. Select this to shut down or
restart.</p></note>
