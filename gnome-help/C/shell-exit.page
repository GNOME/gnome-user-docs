  <p>More links would be good, especially in #logout. Could go final
  as-is. Incomplete for now</p>

  <p>When you've finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it
 (to save power), or leave it powered on and log out.</p>

<section id="logout">
<title>Log out or switch users</title>
  <p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave
 yourself logged in and just switch users. If you switch users, all of
 your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you
 left it when you log back in.</p>
  <p>To <gui>Log Out</gui> or <gui>Switch User</gui>, click your name on the
 top bar and select the appropriate option.</p>

<title>Lock the screen</title>
  <p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
 screen to prevent other people from accessing your files or running
 applications. When you return, simply enter your password to log back in.
 If you don't lock your screen, it will lock automatically after a certain
 amount of time.</p>

  <p>To lock your screen, click your name on the top bar and select
 <gui>Lock Screen</gui>.</p>

  <p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts
 by clicking <gui>Switch User</gui> on the password screen. You can switch
 back to your desktop when they are finished.</p>

<title>Suspend</title>

  <p>To save power, suspend your computer when you aren't using it. If you use
 a laptop, GNOME suspends your computer automatically when you close the lid.
 This saves your state to your computer's memory and powers off most of the
 computer's functions. A very small amount of power is still used during
 suspend.</p>

  <p>To suspend your computer manually, click your name on the top bar and
 select <gui>Suspend</gui>.</p>

<title>Power off or restart</title>

  <p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart,
 first log out by clicking your name on the top bar and selecting
 <gui>Log Out</gui>. You will be returned to the login screen. On the
 login screen, click the power icon on the top bar and select either
 <gui>Restart</gui> or <gui>Power Off</gui>.</p>

  <p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to
 power off or restart the computer, because this will end their sessions.
 If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for your password
 to power off.</p>

<note style="tip">
  <p>If you need to power off or restart quickly, you can do it without logging
 out. Click your name on the top bar, then hold down the <key>Alt</key> key. The
 <gui>Suspend</gui> option will change to <gui>Power Off</gui>. Select this to
 power off or restart.</p>
