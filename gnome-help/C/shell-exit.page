<p>When you've finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it (to save power),
or leave it powered on and just log out.</p>

<title>Log out or switch users</title>
<p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave
yourself logged in and just switch users. If you just switch users, all of
your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you
left it when you log back in.</p>
<p>To log out or switch users, click your name on the top bar and select
the appropriate option.</p>

<title>Lock the screen</title>
<p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
screen to prevent other people from accessing your files and running
applications. When you return, simply enter your password to log back in.
If you don't lock your screen, it will lock automatically after a certain
amount of time.</p>

<p>To lock your screen, click your name on the top bar and select
<gui>Lock Screen</gui>.</p>

<p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts
by clicking <gui>Switch User</gui> on the password screen. You can switch
back to your desktop when they are finished.</p>

<title>Suspend, shut down, or restart.</title>

<p>To save power, turn off your computer when you aren't using it. By default,
GNOME simply suspends your computer. This saves your state to your computer's
memory and powers off most of your computer's functions. A very small amount of
power is still used during suspend.</p>

<p>To suspend your computer, click your name on the top bar and select
<gui>Suspend</gui>. Or, if you have a laptop, simply close the lid. Your
computer will automatically suspend when the lid is closed.</p>

<p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart,
click your name on the top bar, then hold down the <key>Alt</key> key.
The <gui>Suspend</gui> option will change to <gui>Power Off</gui>. Click
this to choose to power off or restart.</p>

<note><p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to
power off or restart the computer, because this will end their sessions.
If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for your password
to power off.</p></note>
