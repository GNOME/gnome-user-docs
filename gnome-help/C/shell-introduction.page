  <title>Visual overview of GNOME</title>

  <p>GNOME features a user interface designed to stay out of your way, minimize
  distractions, and help you get things done. When you first log in, you will
  see the <gui>Activities</gui> overview and the top bar.</p>

<if:choose>
  <if:when test="!platform:gnome-classic">
    <media type="image" src="figures/shell-top-bar.png" width="600" if:test="!target:mobile">
      <p>GNOME Shell top bar</p>
    </media>
  </if:when>
  <if:when test="platform:gnome-classic">
    <media type="image" src="figures/shell-top-bar-classic.png" width="500" if:test="!target:mobile">
      <p>GNOME Shell top bar</p>
    </media>
  </if:when>
</if:choose>

  <p>The top bar provides access to your windows and applications, your
  calendar and appointments, and
  <link xref="status-icons">system properties</link> like sound, networking,
  and power. In the system menu in the top bar, you can change the volume or
  screen brightness, edit your <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> connection details, check your
  battery status, log out or switch users, and turn off your computer.</p>

like "Application windows" by using if:when and if:else ? -->
<section id="activities">
  <title><gui>Activities</gui> overview</title>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">When you start GNOME, you automatically
  enter the <gui>Activities</gui> overview. The overview allows you to access
  your windows and applications. In the overview, you can also just start
  typing to search your applications, files, folders, and the web.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">To access the overview at any time,
  click the Activities button in the top-left corner, or just move your mouse
  pointer to the top-left hot corner. You can also press the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key on your keyboard.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">To access your windows and applications,
  click the button at the bottom left of the screen in the window list. You can
  also press the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key to see an
  overview with live thumbnails of all the windows on the current workspace.</p>

  <media type="image" its:translate="no" src="figures/shell-activities-dash.png" height="65" style="floatend floatright" if:test="!target:mobile, !platform:gnome-classic">
    <p>Activities button and Dash</p>
  </media>
  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">At the bottom of the overview, you will
  find the <em>dash</em>. The dash shows you your favorite and running
  applications. Click any icon in the dash to open that application; if the
  application is already running, it will have a small dot below its icon.
  Clicking its icon will bring up the most recently used window. You can also
  drag the icon onto a workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Right-clicking the icon displays a menu
  that allows you to pick any window in a running application, or to open a new
  window. You can also click the icon while holding down <key>Ctrl</key> to open
  a new window.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">When you enter the overview, you will
  initially be in the windows overview. This shows you live thumbnails of all
  the windows on the current workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Click the grid button (which has nine
  dots) in the dash to display the applications overview. This shows you all the
  applications installed on your computer. Click any application to run it, or
  drag an application to the onto a workspace shown above the installed
  applications. You can also drag an application onto the dash to make it a
  favorite. Your favorite applications stay in the dash even when they’re not
  running, so you can access them quickly.</p>
