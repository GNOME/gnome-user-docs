  <title>Visual overview of GNOME</title>

  <p>GNOME features a user interface designed to stay out of your way, minimize
  distractions, and help you get things done. When you first log in, you will
  see the <gui>Activities</gui> overview and the top bar.</p>

<if:choose>
  <if:when test="!platform:gnome-classic">
    <media type="image" src="figures/shell-top-bar.png" width="600" if:test="!target:mobile">
      <p>GNOME Shell top bar</p>
    </media>
  </if:when>
  <if:when test="platform:gnome-classic">

      <p>GNOME Shell top bar</p>
    </media>
  </if:when>
</if:choose>

  <p>The top bar provides access to your windows and applications, your
  calendar and appointments, and
  <link xref="status-icons">system properties</link> like sound, networking,
  and power. In the system menu in the top bar, you can change the volume or
  screen brightness, edit your <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> connection details, check your
  battery status, log out or switch users, and turn off your computer.</p>

<section id="activities">
  <title><gui>Activities</gui> overview</title>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">When you start GNOME, you automatically
  enter the <gui>Activities</gui> overview. The overview allows you to access
  your windows and applications. In the overview, you can also just start
  typing to search your applications, files, folders, and the web.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">To access the overview at any time,
  click the Activities button in the top-left corner, or just move your mouse pointer to
  the top-left hot corner. You can also press the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key on your keyboard.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">To access your windows and applications,
  click the button at the bottom left of the screen in the window list. You can
  also press the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key to see an
  overview with live thumbnails of all the windows on the current workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">At the bottom of the overview, you will find the <em>dash</em>. The dash
  shows you your favorite and running applications. Click any icon in the
  dash to open that application; if the application is already running, it will
  have a small dot below its icon. Clicking its icon will bring up the most
  recently used window. You can also drag the icon onto a workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Right-clicking the icon displays a menu that allows you to pick any window
  in a running application, or to open a new window. You can also click the
  icon while holding down <key>Ctrl</key> to open a new window.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">When you enter the overview, you will initially be in the windows
  overview. This shows you live thumbnails of all the windows on the current
  workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Click the grid button (which has nine dots) in the dash to display the
  applications overview. This shows you all the applications installed on your
  computer. Click any application to run it, or drag an application to the
  onto a workspace shown above the installed applications. You can also drag an application onto
  the dash to make it a favorite. Your favorite applications stay in the dash
  even when they’re not running, so you can access them quickly.</p>
