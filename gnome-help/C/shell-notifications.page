<title>Notifications and the notification list</title>

<section id="what">
  <title>What is a notification?</title>

  <p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a
  notification will be shown at the top of the screen, or on your lock screen.</p>

  <p>For example, if you get a new chat message or a new email, you will get a
  notification informing you. Chat notifications are given special treatment,
  and are represented by the individual contacts who sent you the chat
  messages.</p>

<!--  <p>To minimize distraction, some notifications first appear as a single line.
  You can move your mouse over them to see their full content.</p>-->

  <p>Other notifications have selectable option buttons. To close one of these
  notifications without selecting one of its options, click the close
  button.</p>

  <p>Clicking the close button on some notifications dismisses them. Others,
  like Rhythmbox or your chat application, will stay hidden in the notification 
  list.</p>

<section id="notificationlist">

  <title>The notification list</title>

  <p>The notification list gives you a way to
  get back to your notifications when it is convenient for you. It appears when
  you click on the clock, or press
  <keyseq><key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq>. The
  notification list contains all the notifications that you have not acted upon
  or that permanently reside in it.</p>

  <p>You can view a notification by clicking on it in the list. You can close
  the notification list by pressing
  <keyseq><key>Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq> again or <key>Esc</key>.</p>

  <p>Click the <gui>Clear List</gui> button to empty the list of
  notifications.</p>

  <title>Hiding notifications</title>

  <p>If you are working on something and do not want to be bothered, you can
  switch off notifications.</p>

  <p>You can hide all notifications by opening the notification list and
  switching <gui>Do Not Disturb</gui> to on at the bottom. Alternatively:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> 
      overview and start typing <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Notifications</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Switch <gui>Do Not Disturb</gui> to on.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>When <gui>Do Not Disturb</gui> is switched on, only very important
  notifications, such as when your battery is critically low, will pop up at
  the top of the screen. All notifications will still be available
  in the notification list when you display it (by clicking on the clock, or by
  pressing <keyseq><key>Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq>), and they will start
  popping up again when you switch <gui>Do Not Disturb</gui> back to off.</p>

  <p>You can also disable or re-enable notifications for individual
  applications from the <gui>Notifications</gui> panel.</p>

<section id="lock-screen-notifications">

  <title>Hiding lock screen notifications</title>

  <p>When your screen is locked, notifications appear on the lock screen. You
  can configure the lock screen to hide these notifications for privacy reasons.</p>

    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> 
      overview and start typing <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Notifications</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item><p>Switch <gui>Lock Screen Notifications</gui> to off.</p></item>
