<title>Notifications and the notification list</title>

<section id="what">
  <title>What is a notification?</title>

  <p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a
  notification will be shown at the top of the screen, or on your lock screen.</p>

  <p>For example, if you get a new chat message or a new email, you will get a
  notification informing you. Chat notifications are given special treatment,
  and are represented by the individual contacts who sent you the chat
  messages.</p>

<!--  <p>To minimize distraction, some notifications first appear as a single line.
  You can move your mouse over them to see their full content.</p>-->

  <p>Other notifications have selectable option buttons. To close one of these
  notifications without selecting one of its options, click the close
  button.</p>

  <p>Clicking the close button on some notifications dismisses them. Others,
  like Rhythmbox or your chat application, will stay hidden in the notification 
  list.</p>

<section id="notificationlist">

  <title>The notification list</title>

  <p>The notification list gives you a way to
  get back to your notifications when it is convenient for you. It appears when
  you click on the clock, or press
  <keyseq><key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq>. The
  notification list contains all the notifications that you have not acted upon
  or that permanently reside in it.</p>

  <p>You can view a notification by clicking on it in the list. You can close
  the notification list by pressing
  <keyseq><key>Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq> again or <key>Esc</key>.</p>

  <p>Click the <gui>Clear List</gui> button to empty the list of
  notifications.</p>

  <title>Hiding notifications</title>

  <p>If you are working on something and do not want to be bothered, you can
  switch off notifications.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui> 
      overview and start typing <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Notifications</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Switch <gui>Notification Popups</gui> to off.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>When switched off, most notifications will not pop up at the top of the
  screen. <!--Very important notifications, such as when your battery is
  critically low, will still pop up.--> Notifications will still be available
  in the notification list when you display it (by clicking on the clock, or by
  pressing <keyseq><key>Super</key><key>V</key></keyseq>), and they will start
  popping up again when you switch the switch back to on.</p>

  <p>You can also disable or re-enable notifications for individual
  applications from the <gui>Notifications</gui> panel.</p>
