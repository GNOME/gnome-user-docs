<title>Screen time and break reminders</title>

<section id="screen-time">
  <title>Screen time</title>

 <p>You can track how much time you spend on your device, enable
 screen time recording, and optionally set daily limits. To do this,
 follow these steps:</p>


  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui>
      overview and type <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Wellbeing</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press the <gui>Enable</gui> button under <gui>Screen Time</gui> to
      enable screen time recording. If a chart is visible on the page, then
      screen time recording is already enabled.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>When screen time recording is enabled, the amount of time you have spent
  logged in to the device each day will be stored for the previous few weeks.
  The times are displayed in the chart, along with averages for days and weeks,
  allowing you to explore how your screen time varies over time. Use the arrow
  buttons below the chart to scroll through past weeks, and click on the bar for
  each day to view its data.</p>

  <p>Screen time data is not shared outside this device or with other users
  on it. It is automatically deleted after a few weeks or when you disable
  screen time recording.</p>

  <p>To limit your daily device use, switch <gui>Screen Time Limit</gui> to on
  and set a <gui>Daily Limit</gui>. When the limit is reached, you will receive
  a notification and the screen will fade to grayscale.</p>

  <p>Your daily limit is represented as a dashed line on the screen time
  usage chart.</p>

  <p>It is recommended to limit your screen time to 8 hours a day and to make time
  for physical activity during those hours. One way to remind yourself to take
  physical activity breaks is to enable
  <link xref="shell-wellbeing#break-reminders">break reminders</link>.</p>

  <p>To disable screen time recording, press the <gui>â‹®</gui> button above the
  screen time chart, then press <gui>Disable Screen Time</gui>.
  This will also disable screen time limits.</p>

<section id="break-reminders">
  <title>Break reminders</title>

  <p>To periodically remind yourself to take a break from using
  your device, enable break reminders by following these steps:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Activities</gui>
      overview and type <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Wellbeing</gui> in the sidebar to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Switch <gui>Eyesight Reminders</gui> or <gui>Movement Reminders</gui> to on.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>When either <gui>Eyesight Reminders</gui> or <gui>Movement Reminders</gui>
  are switched on, you will receive a notification at a chosen interval to
  remind you to take a break from using the device.</p>

  <p>It is recommended to set break intervals that let you rest before you get
  tired, rather than recover afterward. Frequent breaks help prevent
  fatigue, eye strain, upper limb problems and backache. You can choose
  different intervals for short eyesight breaks and longer movement breaks.</p>

  <p>Eyesight breaks remind you to look away from the screen and focus
  your eyes on something else. They also remind you to take a moment to blink,
  stretch, and change position. Movement breaks remind you to move around more, for
  example by walking away from the device completely to stretch your legs.</p>
