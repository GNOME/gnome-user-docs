  <p>Including all applications in the <gui>window switcher</gui> makes switching
 between tasks a single-step process and provides a full picture of which
 applications are running.</p>

  <p>From a workspace:</p>

<list>
  <item><p>Press <keyseq><key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key><key>Tab
  </key></keyseq> to bring up the <gui>window switcher</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Release <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> to select the next
  (highlighted) window in the switcher.</p></item>
  <item><p>Otherwise, still holding down the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">
  Super</key> key, press <key>Tab</key> to cycle through the list of open
  windows, or <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> to cycle
  backwards.</p></item>
</list>

<p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">You can also use the window list on the
  bottom bar to access all your open windows and switch between them.</p>

<note style="tip" if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p>Windows in the window switcher are grouped by application. Previews of
  applications with multiple windows pop down as you click through. Hold down
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> and press <key>`</key> (or the key
  above <key>Tab</key>) to step through the list.</p>
</note>

<note if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p>In the window switcher, applications from different workspaces are divided
  by vertical separators.</p>
</note>

<list>
  <item><p>You can also move between the application icons in the window switcher
  with the <key>&#8594;</key> or <key>&#8592;</key> keys, or select one by
 clicking it with the mouse.</p></item>
  <item><p>Previews of applications with a single window can be displayed with
  the <key>&#8595;</key> key.</p></item>
</list>

<p>From the <gui>Activities</gui> overview:</p>
<list>
  <item><p>Click on a <link xref="shell-windows">window</link> to switch to it
  and leave the overview. If you have multiple
  <link xref="shell-windows#working-with-workspaces">workspaces</link> open, you
  can click on each workspace to view the open windows on each workspace.</p>
  </item>
</list>
