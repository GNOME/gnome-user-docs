  <p>More prose. Maybe a screenshot. 3.0.1</p>

  <p>You can see all the running applications that have a graphical user
  interface in the <em>window switcher</em>. This makes
  switching between tasks a single-step process and provides a full picture of
  which applications are running.</p>

  <p>From a workspace:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Press
      <keyseq><key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq>
      to bring up the <gui>window switcher</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Release <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> to select the next
      (highlighted) window in the switcher.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Otherwise, still holding down the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key>
      key, press <key>Tab</key> to cycle through the list of open
      windows, or <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> to cycle
      backwards.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">You can also use the window list on the
  bottom bar to access all your open windows and switch between them.</p>

  <note style="tip" if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
    <p>Windows in the window switcher are grouped by application. Previews of
    applications with multiple windows pop down as you click through. Hold down
    <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> and press <key>`</key> (or the
    key above <key>Tab</key>) to step through the list.</p>
  </note>

  <p>You can also move between the application icons in the window
  switcher with the <key>&#8594;</key> or <key>&#8592;</key> keys, or
  select one by clicking it with the mouse.</p>

  <p>Previews of applications with a single window can be displayed with
  the <key>&#8595;</key> key.</p>

  <p>From the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, click on a
  <link xref="shell-windows">window</link> to switch to it and leave the
  overview. If you have multiple
  <link xref="shell-windows#working-with-workspaces">workspaces</link> open,
  you can click on each workspace to view the open windows on each
  workspace.</p>
