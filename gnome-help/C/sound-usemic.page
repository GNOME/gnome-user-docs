  <title>Use a different microphone</title>

  <p>You can use an external microphone for audio conferencing, making
  voice recordings, or using other multimedia applications. Even if your
  computer has a built-in microphone or a webcam with a microphone, a
  separate microphone could provide better audio quality.</p>

  <p>If your microphone has a circular TS (<em>tip, sleeve</em>) plug, plug
  it into the appropriate socket on your computer. Most computers have two
  sockets: one for microphones and one for speakers. Look for a picture of
  a microphone next to the socket.
  Microphones plugged into a TS socket will usually be used by default.
  If not, see the instructions below for selecting a default input device.</p>

  <p>If you have a USB microphone, plug it into any USB port on your
  computer. USB microphones act as separate audio devices, and you may
  have to specify which microphone to use by default.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Select a default audio input device</title>
    <item><p>Click your name in the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Sound</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>On the <gui>Input</gui> tab, select the device in the list of devices.
    The input level indicator should respond when you speak.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you don't see your device on the <gui>Input</gui> tab, check the
  <gui>Hardware</gui> tab. Make sure the profile for the device includes
  "input".</p>
