  <title>Use different speakers or headphones</title>

  <p>You can use external speakers or headphones with your computer. Speakers
  usually either connect using a circular TRS (<em>tip, ring, sleeve</em>) plug
  or with USB.</p>

  <p>If your speakers or headphones have a TRS plug, plug it into the appropriate
  socket on your computer. Most computers have two sockets: one for microphones
  and one for speakers. Look for a picture of headphones next to the socket.
  Speakers or headphones plugged into a TRS socket will usually be used by default.
  If not, see the instructions below for selecting the default device.</p>

  <p>Some computers support multi-channel output for surround sound. This usually
  uses multiple TRS jacks, which are often color-coded. If you are unsure which
  plugs go in which sockets, you can test the sound output in the sound settings.
  Click your name in the top bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>, then click
  <gui>Sound</gui>. On the <gui>Hardware</gui> tab, select your speakers in the list
  of devices, then click <gui>Test Speakers</gui>. In the pop-up window, click the
  button for each speaker. Each button will speak its position only to the channel
  corresponding to that speaker.</p>

  <p>If you have USB speakers or headphones, or analog headphones plugged
  into a USB sound card, plug them into any USB port. USB speakers act as
  separate audio devices, and you may have to specify which speakers to
  use by default.</p>
