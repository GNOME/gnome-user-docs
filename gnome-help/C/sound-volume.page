<title>Change the sound volume</title>

  <p>To change the sound volume, click the sound icon on the top bar (it looks
 like a speaker) and move the volume slider left or right. You can completely
 turn off sound by dragging the slider all the way to the left.</p>

  <p>Some keyboards have keys that let you control the volume. They normally look
 like stylized speakers with waves coming out of them. They are often near the
 "F" keys at the top. On laptop keyboards, they are usually on the "F" keys.
 Hold down the <key>Fn</key> key on your keyboard to use them.</p>

  <p>Of course, if you have external speakers, you can also change the volume
 using the volume control on the speakers themselves. Some headphones have a
 volume control too.</p>

 <title>Changing the sound volume for individual applications</title>
 <p>You can change the volume for one application, but leave the volume for
 others unchanged. This is useful if you're listening to music and browsing the
 web, for example. You might want to turn off the volume in the web browser so
 sounds from websites don't interrupt the music.</p>
 <p>Some applications have volume controls in their main windows. If your
 application has one of these, use that to change the volume. Otherwise, click
 the sound icon on the top bar and select <gui>Sound Settings</gui>. Go to the
 <gui>Applications</gui> tab and change the volume of the application there.</p>
 <p>Only applications that are playing sounds will be listed. If an application
 is playing sounds but isn't listed, it might not support the feature that lets
 you control its volume in this way. In that case, you can't change its volume.</p>
