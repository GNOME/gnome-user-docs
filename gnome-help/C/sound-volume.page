<title>Change the sound volume</title>

<p>To change the sound volume, click the volume icon on the top bar and move the volume slider up or down. You can completely turn off sound by checking <gui>Mute</gui>.</p>

<p>Some keyboards have keys that let you control the volume. They normally look like stylized speakers with "waves" coming out of them, and are often near the "F" keys (e.g. <key>F7</key>).</p>

<p>Of course, if you have external speakers, you can also change the volume using the volume control on the speakers themselves. Some headphones have a volume control too.</p>

 <title>Changing the sound volume for individual applications</title>
 <p>You can change the volume for one application, but leave the volume for others unchanged. This is useful if you're listening to music and browsing the web, for example - you might want to turn off the volume in the web browser so sounds from websites don't interrupt the music.</p>
 <p>Some applications have volume controls in their main windows. If your application has one of these, use that to change the volume. Otherwise, click the volume icon on the top bar and click <gui>Sound Preferences</gui>. Go to the <gui>Applications</gui> tab and change the volume of the application there.</p>
 <p>Only applications that are playing sounds will be listed. If an application is playing sounds but isn't listed, it might not support the feature that lets you control its volume in this way. In that case, you can't change its volume.</p>
