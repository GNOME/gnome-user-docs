<p>The dialog to enable an account now has <gui>Enable account</gui> in the
<gui>Action</gui> drop-down, along with the password-setting options. It's
not clear to me what this does. The other options all enable the account,
and in a very specific way.</p>

  <p>You can add multiple user accounts to your computer. Give one account
  to each person in your household or company. Every user has their own
  home folder, documents, and settings.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar, then click the picture next to your
  name to open the <gui>User Accounts</gui> window.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> in the top right corner and type your
  password to make changes. You must be an administrative user to add user
  accounts.</p></item>
  <item><p>In the list of accounts on the left, click the <gui>+</gui> button
  to add a new user account.</p></item>
  <item><p>If you want the new user to have administrative access to the computer,
  select <gui>Administrator</gui> for the account type in the dropdown menu.
  Administrators can do things  like add and delete users, install software and
  drivers, and change the date and time.</p></item>
  <item><p>Enter the new user's full name. The username will be filled in
  automatically based on the full name. The default is probably OK, but you can
  change it if you  like.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Create</gui> when you're done.</p></item>
  <item><p>The account is initially disabled until you choose what to do about
  the user's password. Under <gui>Login Options</gui> click  <gui>Account
  disabled</gui> next to <gui>Password</gui>. Use the <gui>Action</gui> drop-down
  list to set the password now, allow the user to log in without a password, or
  have the user set their password the first time they log in.</p>
  <p>If you choose <gui>Set a password now</gui>, have the user type their
  password in the <gui>New password</gui> and <gui>Confirm password</gui> fields.
  See <link xref="user-goodpassword"/>.</p>
  <p>You can also click the button next to the
  <gui>New password</gui> field to select a randomly generated secure password.
  These passwords are hard for others to guess, but they can be hard to remember,
  so be careful.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Change</gui>.</p></item>
</steps>
	
<note><p>Back in the <gui>User Accounts</gui> window you can click the image next
 to the user's name on the right to set an image for the account. This image will
 be shown in the login window. GNOME provides some stock photos you can use, or
 you can select your own or take a picture with your webcam.</p>
