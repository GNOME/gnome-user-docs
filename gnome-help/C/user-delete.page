  <title>Delete a user account</title>

  <p>You can add multiple user accounts to your computer. See
  <link xref="user-add"/> to learn how. If somebody is no longer using
  your computer, you can delete that user's account.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar, then click the picture next to your
  name to open the <gui>Users</gui> window.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> in the top right corner and type your
  password to make changes. You must be an administrative user to delete user
  accounts.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select the user you want to delete and click the
  <gui style="button">-</gui> button.</p></item>
  <item><p>Each user has their own home folder for their files and settings.
  You can choose to keep or delete the user's home folder. Click <gui>Delete
  Files</gui> if you're sure they won't be used anymore and you need to free up
  disk space. These files are permanently deleted. They can't be recovered. You
  may want to back up the files to an external drive or CD before deleting
  them.</p></item>
