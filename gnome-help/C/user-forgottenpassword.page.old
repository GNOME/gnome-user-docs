  <title>I forgot my password!</title>

<comment><cite date="2011-06-07">mimico</cite><p>These instructions were written and tested using gnome3 from ppa.  I attempted following them on Fedora15 and locked the system out completely (had to reinstall os).  There is still hope, but getting this page accurate and safe (so users don't completely lock themselves out) will be very time consuming.  Perhaps distro specific pages are needed for this topic?</p></comment>

<comment><cite date="2011-04-03">shaunm</cite><p>Marking final for 3.0.
This could use some work for 3.2. There are some less drastic things.
Like if there's another admin user on your computer, have them reset
your password in the user accounts settings.</p>
<p>Also: merge two grubs instructions (almost equal), use clicky-clicky
instructions as much as possible, and let's get some real keyring docs
integrated in gnome-help then link there.</p>

     It is important to not only choose <link xref="user-goodpassword">a good and secure password</link>, but one that you can also remember.
     If you have forgotten the password to log in to your computer account, you can follow the following steps to reset it.
  </p>
  <note style="important">
  <p>
     If you have an encrypted home directory, you will not be able to reset a forgotten password.
  </p>

  If you simply want to change your password, see <link xref="user-changepassword"/>.
