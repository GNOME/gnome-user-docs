<title>What is the "windows" key?</title>

<p>When you press the <em>windows</em> key, the activities overview is displayed. This key can usually be found on the bottom-left of your keyboard, next to the <key>Alt</key> key, and often has a window/squares icon on it. It is sometimes called the super key, logo key, or system key.</p>

<note>
<p>If you have an Apple keyboard, there will not be a windows key on your keyboard. The <key>Command (Cmd)</key> key can be used instead.</p>
</note>

 <p>Need to add info on changing the keybinding using the new preferences windows.</p>
