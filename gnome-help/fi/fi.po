# Finnish translation for GNOME User Guide
# Launchpad Contributors, see translator-credits
#
# Merged from Launchpad translations in "keep gnome.org translation always"
# way as follows:
#
# msgmerge --no-location LPTRANSLATION.po L10NGNOMEORGUPDATEDTRANSLATION.po > COMBINED.po
# msgcat --no-location --use-first L10NGNOMEORGUPDATEDTRANSLATION.po COMBINED.po > fi.po
#
# The first msgmerge unfortunately drops all the gnome.org translations and
# has too many strings, thus the second msgcat is used. Theoretically the
# the msgmerge already should update the combined file into a such form that
# it's valid against current .pot.
#
# Tips on better merges welcome. The only exception was to copy translator-
# credits manually from the LP file.
