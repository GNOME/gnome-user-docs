  <title>Character Picker Applet</title>

  <para>
   <application>Character Picker</application> applet, shown in <xref
   linkend="charpickapplet-fig">, allows you to easily write many
   characters which are not available on standard keyboards such as
   accented characters, certain mathemathical symbols and punctuation,
   and some other special symbols.  To add this applet to a 
   <interface>Panel</interface>, 
   right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface> and choose
   <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
    <guisubmenu>Add to panel</guisubmenu>

  <!-- ============= Usage  ================================ -->
  <sect3 id="charpickapplet-usage">
   <title>Usage</title>
   <para>
    First, bring the cursor focus to the <application>Character
    Picker</application> applet by left-clicking on one of the
    characters displayed in the applet.  Specify the character group
    by pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard. (For a
    complete list of the character groups and corresponding keys, see
    <xref linkend="charpickapplet-characters">.) For example,
    to see the  various accented versions of the "a" letter, press
    "a".  After you have found the correct letter or symbol,
    left-click on it to copy the symbol into the buffer.  The
    character should appear as a depressed button.  This is similar to
    the common Copy command available in many programs.  To paste the
    symbol in any window, just click in the window with the middle
    mouse button.  Most applications which have Copy and Paste
    features will also allow you to paste the symbol using its Paste
    command.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) character support</title>
    <para>
     Note that some applications do not support ISO-8859-1
     characters.  These applications will not display some characters
     from the <application>Character Picker</application> applet.
    </para>
   </note>

   <note>
    <title>Cut and Paste in X</title>
    <para>
     The X Windows system allows you to copy and paste text by 
     highlighting it with the first mouse button to copy the text and
     then pasting the text by pressing the middle mouse button.  
     Note that <application>Character Picker</application> uses the
     same copy buffer as X uses. Thus, when you
     select a character in the <application>Character
     Picker</application> it replaces any previous text in the buffer
     from highlighting text.  Similarly, if you have selected a
     character in <application>Character Picker</application> and then
     highlight text, the highlighted text will replace the character
     in the buffer and the character's button will no longer appear
     depressed.  
    </para>
   </note>

    Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the
    following items:
