  <title>Jon's Binary Clock Applet</title>

  <para>
   <application>Jon's Binary Clock</application> applet, shown in <xref
   linkend="jbcapplet-fig">, shows the time in an unusual form: binary
   coded decimal. It has twenty-four LEDs which represent the hours,
   minutes and seconds by illuminating the appropriate LED.  To add this
   applet to a <interface>Panel</interface>, 
   right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface> and choose

    You don't need to do anything special to this clock. It just
    sits there and flashes lights at you.

    Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the

    <para>
      BCD stands for binary-coded decimal, a way of representing 
      normal denary (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) numbers as what programmers
      call &quot;a set of binary numbers in four bits, thus removing the
      numbers A to F&quot;. If this doesn't make sense, just be aware
      that this clock is an amusement for programmers, and serves
      no really useful purpose.
    </para>
    <para>
      It helps to read this clock upside-down! Start at the bottom and 
      read up to the top.
    </para>
    <para>
      The right-hand pair of columns shows the two digits of the seconds:
      the units on the right, the tens on the left. The centre pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the minutes. The left hand pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the hours.
    </para>
    <para>
      You add up the values of the illuminated LEDs in each column.
      You should get a number between zero to nine for each. That's
      the time.
    </para>

         The bottom LED represents 1 when it is illuminated.

    <para>
      It is probably simplest to decipher the hours and minutes
      first before trying to follow the seconds, which are always 
      changing.
    </para>

    <para>
     As an example, we can read the time in <xref
     linkend="jbcapplet-fig">. Let's start with the hour.  The first
     column has only 1 LED on, in the second lowest position, so this
     gives us <quote>2</quote> for the first digit of the hour.  The
     second column has no LEDs on, so we have a <quote>0</quote> for
     the second digit of the hour.  So the hour is <quote>20</quote>,
     or 8PM for people who like AM/PM notation.  Looking at the
     minutes, we have <quote>0</quote> for the first digit, and
     <quote>1</quote> for the second digit since only the bottom LED
     is lit.  This gives us "20:01" so far.  Lastly, we have the
     seconds.  For the first digit, we have the lowest two LED's
     lit. These have value 1 (for the lowest) and 2 (second lowest)
     for a total of <quote>3</quote>.  And the second column of the
     seconds has the top LED lit, with a value of
     <quote>8</quote>. Thus, the time is <quote>20:01:38</quote>, or
     <quote>8:01:38PM</quote>.

    If you add it to a vertical panel, it is a nice size. If you then
    move it to a horizonal panel, it changes size in the  horizontal
    panel. If you move it back to a vertical panel, it doesn't change
    size back, and forces the panel to widen itself.
