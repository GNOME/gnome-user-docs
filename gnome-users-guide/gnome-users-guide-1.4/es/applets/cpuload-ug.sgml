   <title>The CPU load applet</title> 

   <para> 
     The <application>cpuload_applet</application> is a small monitor
     applet which sits in your panel and tells you how much CPU is
     being used. 
   </para>

   <sect3 id="cpuload-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      You don't need to do anything to this applet. It will sit and
      run in your panel. Various options to alter its display are
      available. 
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>cpuload_applet</application> divides CPU use into
      four sorts:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>User</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This measures CPU use in "userland": ie, things not talking to 
         the kernel. The default colour for this is yellow.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
 
     <varlistentry>
      <term>System</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This measures CPU use that involves the kernel: lots of talking
         between memory and disc, for example. The default colour is pale
         grey.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
 
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Nice</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This measures CPU use which is not "nice": running at a high priority.
         The default colour is medium grey. 
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
 
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Idle</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Idle measures unused CPU capacity. The default colour is black.

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Default Properties...</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This opens the <guilabel>multiload_applet dialogue box</guilabel>

         you to alter the default properties of this and related monitor 
         applets.

     <varlistentry>

      <listitem>
       <para>
         This opens the <guilabel>multiload_applet dialogue box</guilabel>
         <link linkend="cpuload-properties">described below</link> which

         properties.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         This option will run the <command>gtop</command> which
         starts up the GNOME System Monitor. <application>gtop</application>
         gives a much more detailed look at your system and what's happening

    <para>
      Like several of the monitor applets,
      <application>cpuload_applet</application> has two ways of setting
      preferences. You can make changes that affect any of this group 
      (<application>cpuload_applet</application>, <application>memload_applet</application>,
      <application>swapload_applet</application>, <application>netload_applet</application>
      and <application>loadavg_applet</application>) in one large dialogue
      box. This is useful if you run one or more of them. These are the
      settings used by default. They are reached from the
      <guimenuitem>Default Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>

    </figure>

    <para>
      Or you can change just the properties for 
      <application>cpuload_applet</application>. This is useful for when
      you only use <application>cpuload_applet</application> or want to
      try new combinations out. It is reached from the 
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      If you use the <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item
      and edit the preferences for just this applet, you must uncheck
      the <guibutton>Use default properties</guibutton> checkbox before
      you can alter any settings.

    <para>
      The changes you can make to the properties are three:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Colours</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the colours used for the different forms of 
         CPU usage displayed by clicking on the colour boxes. This
         invokes the GNOME colour wheel.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Speed</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the speed that the graph proceeds with this.
         It is measured in milliseconds. The highest value is 1,000,000,000
         and the lowest is 1. The default is a more sensible 500.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Size</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the size of the applet with this. It is measured
         in pixels. The default value is 40, and the range is from 1 pixel
         to whatever you like. In a vertical panel, this refers to the
         height. In a horizontal panel, it refers to the width. 
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </sect3>
  
   <sect3 id="cpuload-bugs">
    <title> Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
    <para>
      Resizing and then altering the panel orientation can result in
      intermittent problems, although they now fix themselves after a
      short period.
