   <title>Usage</title>


   <para><application>Desk Guide</application> applet helps you
    navigate all of the virtual desktops available on your system. The
    <application>X Window</application> system, working in
    hand with a piece of software called a "window manager", allows
    you to create more than one virtual desktop to organize your
    work, with different applications running on each
    desktop. Each desktop can also be subdivided by the window
    manager into rows and columns of working space, called
    "desk areas". <application>Desk
    Guide</application> applet is a navigational tool to get around
    the various desktops and desk areas, providing a miniature road
    map in the GNOME panel showing all your virtual desktops (also
    known as workspaces) and desk areas, and allowing you to switch
    easily between them.</para>

    <para><application>Desk Guide</application> applet works
    hand-in-hand with the window manager, the piece of software such
    as Sawfish or Enlightenment that handles the look, feel and performance of
    your windows. The window manager lays down borders, resizes windows, places
    and moves them. The window manager is in charge of the various
    desktops. <application>Desk Guide</application> applet handles the
    navigation.</para>
 
    <para><application>Desk Guide</application> applet displays
    miniature versions of all your available desktops, including
    outlined boxes representing the applications running in each
    desktop window. The desktop currently in use is
    highlighted. Mouse-click on a representation of a desktop in
    <application>Desk Guide</application> applet to switch to display
    a different virtual desktop on your monitor.</para>

    <para>Click and hold with your middle mouse button on any window
    image in <application>Desk Guide</application> applet to drag the
    window around your virtual desktops.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>Different window managers use different jargon to describe
      virtual desktops and the subdivided workspaces within
      them. <application>Enlightenment</application> divides your
      working area into "desktops," and then subdivides those into
      "screens." <application>Sawfish</application>, formerly known as
      <application>Sawmill</application> divides your
      working area into "workspaces" and then subdivides those into
      columns and rows. <application>Desk Guide</application> applet
      calls the workspaces "desktops" and the areas within them
      "viewports". See your window manager's documentation for more
      informaton on setting up and managing your virtual workspaces.</para>

    <para>Mouse-clicking on the arrow on the left side of
    <application>Desk Guide</application> applet brings up the
