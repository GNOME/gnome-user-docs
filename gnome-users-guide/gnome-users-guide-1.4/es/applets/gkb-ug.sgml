    to switch the keyboard
    mapping.

     the panel. You can now set the applets size from the 
     <guilabel>Applet size</guilabel> pull down list. Set the size to 
     <guibutton>Normal</guibutton> if you want a smaller applet. 
     If you have plenty of space or like nice big flags on you panel, 
     set the option to <guibutton>Big</guibutton>.

An often formulated user wish was to implement the keymap switching using 
hotkeys. The developers proudly announce, that keyboard initiated switching now works. The hotkey combination that allows to change keymaps is set to
<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Shift</keycap></keycombo> (<keycap>Alt</keycap> being the left <keycap>Alt</keycap> key). You can customize this hotkey sequence from the <interface>GKB Properties</interface> window's 
<guilabel>Options</guilabel> tab. Click on the <guibutton>Grab hotkey</guibutton> button and press the keys you want to set. The key combination is displayed in the <interface>input box</interface> near the button (you may see something like: <keysym>Control-Shift_R</keysym>). Finally, click on <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> or <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to finalize the new settings.

    </para>
    <para>
      <application>GNOME Keyboard</application>  switches the keyboard
    map by issuing a command to X Window
    System. X Window System has two mechanisms for setting keyboard
    mapping: older one called "xmodmap" and a newer one, based on the
    so-called "Xkb extension". If you have Xkb enabled, you should use
    it and switch keyboard layouts by issuing a command
    <command>setxkbmap <replaceable>LC</replaceable></command>. It
    comes with a number of various keyboard layout files, usually in
    directory <filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols</filename>.
    </para>
    <para> If you do not have Xkb extension enabled, or if it just
    does not cover the language you need, you should use the older
    <command>xmodmap</command> mechanism. In this case, you need to
    have a file which describes keyboard layout in a special format
    (see manual page for <command>xmodmap</command> for details), and
    the command should be <command>xmodmap
    <replaceable>filename</replaceable> </command>. <application>GNOME
    Keyboard</application>  includes a
    number of keyboard layout files, which are installed in the
    directory <filename>/usr/share/xmodmap</filename>; these files
    have names like <filename>xmodmap.de</filename>. To use one of
    these files, you can use the command <command>gkb_xmmap
    <replaceable>LC</replaceable></command>
    which is equivalent to <command>xmodmap
    /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.<replaceable>LC</replaceable></command>:
    for example,
      <command>gkb_xmmap hu</command> is the same as <command>xmodmap
    /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.hu</command>.
