  <!-- ============= Bugs ================================== --> <!--
  This section should describe known bugs and limitations of the
  program if there are any - please be frank and list all problems you
  know of -->
  <sect3 id="gweather-bugs">
   <title>Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
   <sect4 id="blocking-io">
    <title>Blocking Input/Output</title>
    <para>
     Even though <application>GNOME Weather</application> now uses
     non-blocking I/O to retrieve data from the network, there are
     still some steps that block execution.  Most notably,
     establishing a TCP connection to remote hosts is a blocking
     operation.  Because the NWS and IWIN web servers are often
     heavily loaded, this step may take a significant amount of time.
     While that happens, the application is unable to respond to CORBA
     requests from the <interface>Panel</interface>.  In its current
     implementation, the <interface>Panel</interface> iterates through
     all applications and sends frequent CORBA requests (eg. for
     saving state).  If an applet cannot respond for any reason, then
     the <interface>Panel</interface> will block waiting for a
     response.
    </para>

    <para>
     While the <interface>Panel</interface> is blocked, it will not
     respond to any user (or application) requests.  For instance,
     <interface>Panel</interface> movement and
     <interface>Panel</interface> menus (the ones that appear upon a
     right click) will not work.  However, other applets in the
     <interface>Panel</interface> should work (unless they have made a
     CORBA request to the <interface>Panel</interface>, eg. for
     querying <interface>Panel</interface> size).  As soon as the
     blocking operation in <application>GNOME Weather</application>
     completes, things should return to normal (and user interface
     requests that were buffered will be executed).
    </para>

    <para>
     There is an experimental version of <application>GNOME
     Weather</application> that uses a separate thread for HTTP
     processing, which may be incorporated  (temporarily) in the next
     release.  However, the final solution is
     <application>gnome-vfs</application> which will  be part of GNOME
     2.0 and will offer cross-platform support for fully asynchronous
     I/O.

   </para>

   <sect4 id="unnamed1">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather freezes my Panel?</title>
    <para>
     This is due to the blocking nature of certain network operations
     (see also <xref linkend="blocking-io">) and due to the way the
     <interface>Panel</interface> currently works.
    </para>
   </sect4>

   <sect4 id="unnamed2">
    <title>Why does location list appears empty?</title>

    <para>
     This is probably because the <filename>Locations</filename> file
     was not installed in the proper place.  This is usually because
     <application>GNOME Weather</application> and GNOME were not
     configured in the same way.  The file containing the locations
     must be installed in the <filename>gweather</filename>
     subdirectory, under the gnome data directory.  You can find out
     the latter with the <userinput>gnome-config --datadir</userinput>
     command.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you have compiled gnome-applets yourself, make sure that you
     have used <userinput>configure --prefix=`gnome-config --prefix`
     --sysconfdir=`gnome-config --sysconfdir`</userinput>.  Binary
     RPMs assume a that the prefix and sysconfdir are
     <filename>/usr</filename> and <filename>/etc</filename>,
     respectively.  If you have compiled GNOME yourself with different
     options, you need to download and compile gnome-applets yourself.
    </para>
   </sect4>

   <sect4 id="unnamed3">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather display a question mark and dashes
     for current conditions?</title>

    <para>
     This will happen if <application>GNOME Weather</application>
     cannot access the NWS server for  any reason.  This may be
     because your network  connection is down, or the NWS server is
     down, or maybe the NWS server does not currently have any
     information about your location.
    </para>
   </sect4>

   <sect4 id="unnamed4">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather say that a forecast is not
     available?</title>

    <para>
     If you have enabled detailed forecasts, then it is possible that
     one may not be available for your location.  In this case, try
     disabling detailed forecasts.
    </para>

    <para>
     Another possible reason is that the IWIN server is down and
     <application>GNOME Weather</application> cannot retrieve forecast
     information.  The problem should go away as soon as the IWIN
     server is up  again.
    </para>
   </sect4>

<!--
   <sect4>
    <title>Why is the radar map not displayed?</title>

    <para>
     The most common reason is that the webserver containing the radar
     image is down.  You may also want to use the location editor (see
     <xref linkend="location-editor">) to make sure that the radar
     image URL for your location is valid.
    </para>

    <para>
     Also, if the image is in an uncommon format, <application>GNOME
     Weather</application>  may not be able to display it.  Images are
     displayed using the GNOME libraries, which supports practically
     all available formats, so this problem should be very
     rare. </para>
