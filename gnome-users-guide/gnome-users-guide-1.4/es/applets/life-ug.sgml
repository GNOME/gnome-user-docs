    The GNOME panel <application>life</application> is an applet
    which runs <quote>the game of life</quote> according to Conway's rules in a
    small grid in your panel, with the organism and background colour
    constantly changing. It is part of the gnome-applets package.

       Once it is present, you don't need to do anything to the life
       applet. It will run happily on its own.
     </para>

      Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the

     <para>
       The Game of Life as described by Conway in 1970 has the following 
       rules:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Start with a grid (usually a plain square) of squares. Fill 
         a proportion of them with cells, randomly placed. This is generation
         zero.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Any cell with two or three neighbours survives to the next
         generation.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         On any square with no cell and three neighbours, a new cell is
         born. On any other square, no new cells are born.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Repeat generations.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>

     <para>
       The game will eventually end in one of a number of ways:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         The death of all cells (theoretical, but uncommon in the life
         applet).
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         A fixed equilibrium with all remaining cells surviving but
         creating no new cells.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         A dynamic equilibrium where the game cycles continually through
         a particular sequence of patterns.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>

     <para>
       For interest value, the current grid in the life applet is 78 by 78 
       and the proportion of squares filled with cells is 50&percnt;.
