  <!-- ============= Waht is ESD?  ================================ -->
  <sect3 id="soundmonitorapplet-esd">
   <title>Sound in GNOME</title>
   <para>
      GNOME uses a special program, called ESD (the Enlightened Sound
      Daemon), as an intermediary between applications and sound
      card. ESD allows mixing sound from several applications, so that
      you can play a game and hear the sound effects while listening
      to an aduio CD. To hear any sound from GNOME applications, ESD
      must be running. Normally GNOME is configured so that ESD is
      started every time you login; if for some reason this is not so,
      click on the <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> button (the foot
      icon) and select
     <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Setting</guisubmenu>
      <guisubmenu>Multimedia</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Sound</guimenuitem>
     </menuchoice>
      and make sure that the option <guilabel>Enable sound server
      startup</guilabel> is enabled, so that the next time you login,
      ESD will be started. You can also start or stop ESD
      using the <application>Sound Monitor</application> applet as
      described below.
    </para>
    <para>
      Non-GNOME applications usually are not aware of ESD and need
      full control of the audio card --- they can not share audio card
      with other applications. This means with such applications, you
      can either have sound from GNOME or sound from non-GNOME
      application, but not both. In many cases, this means that you
      have to temporarily stop ESD to get sound from  non-GNOME
      applications (otherwise, you get error messages like
      <command>Device /dev/dsp busy</command>). 
    </para>
  </sect3>

 
  <!-- ============= Usage  ================================ -->
  <sect3 id="soundmonitorapplet-usage">
   <title>Usage</title>
   <para>
    <application>Sound Monitor</application> always displays the
    volume of sound being produced on your system graphically.
    You may control sound by turning ESD on or off by right-clicking
    on the applet and selecting <guimenuitem>Place Esound in
    standby</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Resume Esound</guimenuitem>
    respectively, as described below.  
   </para>

   <para>
    Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the
    following items:
    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <guimenuitem>Manager&hellip;</guimenuitem> &mdash; brings
       up the <link linkend="soundmonitorapplet-manager">
       <interface>Sound Monitor Manager</interface></link> dialog,
       which allows you to view and control current ESD settings.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <guimenuitem>Place Esound in
       standby</guimenuitem>/<guimenuitem>Resume
       Esound</guimenuitem>/<guimenuitem>Start
       Esound</guimenuitem> &mdash; At any time, you will only
       have one of these three items, depending on whether ESD is
       running and what its status is. The first two menu items
       allow you to
       temporarily place ESD in standby and then resume ESD.
       This is useful if you have a sound application which is
       unable to work with ESD, but needs direct access to the
       sound device. The third allows you to start
       <application>Esound</application> if it is not started.

        axis. (Since
        the default theme is not a scope, this control does not do
        anything until you have modified the theme, as described
        below.) A value of 1 corresponds to time scale of 44 100
        pixels/second; value of X gives 44 100/X pixels/second. (These
        numbers appear because the standard for CD-quality audio

  <!-- ============= ESDPVD ================================== -->
  <sect3 id="esdpvd">
   <title>The Esound Persistent Volume Daemon (ESDPVD)</title>
   <para>
    The <application>Sound Monitor</application> applet comes with a
    companion program called the <application>Esound Persistent Volume
    Daemon</application>
    (ESDPVD), which can run in the background and remembers the volume
    and balance of each stream that connects to the sound server. The
    main purpose of <application>ESDPVD</application> is to be used in
    conjunction with the <application>Sound Monitor</application>
    applet's <interface>Manager</interface> dialog 
    to retain volume levels for individual streams that
    connect to the ESD sound server.
   </para>
   <para>
    As an example, suppose you are running the
    <application>GTCD</application> CD Player and you 
    lower its volume using the <interface>Manager</interface> window. Normally
    the volume setting will be lost when the program (in this case
    <application>GTCD</application>) is exited and
    restarted. However, if <application>esdpvd</application> is
    running and you start <application>GTCD</application> again, the
    volume will be restored to its previous (in this case, 
    lower) value from before. 
   </para>
   <para>
    If you configure GNOME to start <application>ESDPVD</application>
    each time GNOME is started (using the
    <interface>control-center</interface>'s <interface>Startup 
    Programs</interface> section), <application>ESDPVD</application>
    will remember  sound volume and balance customizations between
    GNOME sessions. 
   </para>
   <para>
    <application>ESDPVD</application> also remembers volume and
    balance adjustments to cached samples (often used for interface
    sound events such as button clicks, menus, etc.).
