   <para>
    You don't need to do anything special to use this applet. It will
    report the position of your cursor as you move your mouse about.
    Clicking on the <application>Where Am I?</application> will "grab"
    the cursor, causing it to change to a cross-hairs shape.  Once the
    cursor has been grabbed, you can can drag the cursor to measure
    the dimensions of an area on the screen.  A second click will
    ungrab the cursor, and restore normal operation.
   </para>
